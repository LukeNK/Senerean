        <h1>Sign convention</h1>
        <h2>Standard:</h2>

            - Name is capitalize, but not the type of the road
            - Third line is blank space in case the name is too long
            - Forth line will contain a simple compass navigation
            example:
        </p>
        <code>
            SEA CLIFF
            ave
            [blank space]
            <-N S-> 
            In case it is a split
            N SEA CLIFF ave
            <-N
            S SEA CLIFF ave
            S->
        </code>
        <p>
            - The order of the direction should follow the NEWS
            - The sign text decoration shall using white dye and glow inksack
        </p>
        <h2>Placement:</h2>
        <p>
            - Use glow ink sack and spruce sign
            - The sign should have the background light as mild blue
            - The rotation of the sign shouldn't be matter, but prefer facing at confusing intersections
            - In an avenue intersection, the sign is at the middle of the road, and raised by smooth stone to be horizontal at eye level if necessary
            - In a street intersection, the sign is located at the corner of the intersection, raised by 3 blocks from the street level using spruce fence
