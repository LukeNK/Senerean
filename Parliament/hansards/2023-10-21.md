# The Senerean House of Commons
## Question period
2023-10-21 10:00

### Speaker
Before starting, I just want to inform all Members of the House of Commons that the Parliament's uniform is currently being drawn with the support of Estican artist Riaa, who is witnessing this debate from the gallery. Please Members welcome Riaa.

Now, the question period shall start. The official opposition, you now have the floor.

### Conservative Party
Thank you, Speaker and welcome Riaa to Senerean. As it happens, today I want to compare the Senerean healthcare system with the rest of the Union, and prominently, the Estican healthcare report about the Senerean's flu. Why it is happening that the Estican news outlets are confirming cases and deaths relating to the Senerean's flu, but there is absolutely no action from our Prime Minister? What is the deal? Are we denying the reports from the majority of the world?

### Liberal Party
Firstly, thank you Riaa for joining our Parliament today and your great contribution to the standard uniform we are making.

Dear Honourable Speaker, my opposition right here is making claims without any numbers to prove it. Here I have it: Senerean is a nation with the healthiest citizens in the Union and one of the most developed healthcare systems. According to that system, claims about "Senerean's flu" don't reflect the number of patients in our hospital. Doctors have found little difference between what the rest of the Union called "Senerean's flu" compared to our standard seasonal flu. So instead of throwing big words around this chamber, why don't you back up with a sword... I meant a source! That is intended for humorous purposes.

### Environment Party
Thank you Riaa for joining our lower chamber today and witnessing an absolute joke that we are having as the Prime Minister of Senerean! That, also, is intended for humorous purposes.

Honourable Speaker, the problem with the Prime Minister's claim is that the government is refusing to register Senerean's flu as a separate problem, but instead merged it with the common flu. We believe the first step is to simply recognize Senerean's flu, which the government is refusing to do! How on earth could we open the understanding of this flu when we don't even consider it as a unique and separate illness?

### Liberal Party
It is important to understand that there is a procedure to admit, register, and recognize an illness as a separate entity in our national healthcare system. The problem with Senerean's flu is there is no clear distinction between seasonal common flu and the description of what is called "Senerean's flu. Let me ask you a simple math question, if a is equal to b, then why should we consider them two different entities when applying the same to both of them? I hope my simplified explanation can clear up for the Member

### Conservative Party
Honourable Speaker, the problem with the Liberal Party is that they are not trying to clear out the distinction. However, the public does. A research lab from the Environment Management College with the support from the Ninoarura Central Hospital has successfully aquired the virus that caused Senerean's flu from Wilhelma. Within a day of receiving the sample and working with Wilhelma professionals, they together discovered a higher transmission rate among people with pets. Is that enough distinction, when we found out that the two viruses are fundamentally different? You told us to back our information with sources, and we did, now what? Are you going to respond appropriately to the threat, or we just sit there and try to change the name of every ministry until our budget runs out? We ask for action, not for words!

### Liberal Party
We once again state that: our researchers are working hard on the topic. Of course, the government also received a copy of the research, but peer review and careful examination of the report are necessary before informing the public. A false alert from the government would create widespread fear and result in a devastating impact on our economy.

### Conservative Party
Honourable Speaker, we would be all dead when this government informs the public. I simply ask the government, will you tell us your response to the Senerean's flu?

### Liberal Party
Honourable Speaker, the government will respond when necessary. We don't want to let our citizens live in fear like what the official opposition is suggesting. As for now, constant collaboration with scientists from around the Union is necessary, and we will do it.

### Speaker
Since there is no further question in this session, the House of Commons is dismissed.
