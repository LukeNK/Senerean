## Tainted Tattoos issue
2023-02-19 14:00

### The Speaker
There has been a rise in infection rates across the country from unsterilized tattoo needles. Please all parties state their case and solution on this matter.

### Liberal Party
Senerean is the top nation about health and safety in our union—that was the government top priority for the last few years. Despite we are facing constraints in our budget, we have to remember that the safety of our citizens is extremely important for Senerean's future. That's why our party proposed a solution: the government must regulate and require license to all tattoos artist. This not only ensure the best interest to all people who are passionate with this form of art, it also give the government a chance to prove that we do care to the minority. We give the floor back to the Speaker.

### Conservative Party
We understand that it is crucial for the government to ensure the safety and well-being of citizens. However, we have to remember that just a few week ago, the Liberal Party promised to reduce the average income tax from 60% to 40%. Well... a week after that statement, our tax already increased to 65%! If we keep going like this, we will eventually undo our past efforts and become a country where there is no disposable income! When will we draw a line? The government must seriously consider this is the very end and leave the free market do its job; our citizens are smart enough to choose the right option for themselves. If we keep caring for every small actions like this, we will eventually reach to the point where our government is the freedom jail for our own citizens!

### Liberal Party
How many tax percecntage this issue will decrease, by not helping our citizens? The humanity cost will outdone the monetary cost, which make it unjustifiable. In no way our government should sacrifice the people's need just to give others a few extra seners to spend!

### Conservative Party
And how many people unable to make a decision by themself, by not researching the artist before hand? We have to remind the government about what they promised, and spend every seners wisely.

### Government: Prime Minister
We understand the necessary to keep the citizens safe from all dangers, but we also understand the freedom of choice that is available to each citizens. We further understand the fact that our government should extend that freedom of choice and increase the disposable income margin of each citizens. We acknowledge the necessary safety that the government should provide to each citizens, but we admit that the suggested action will not able to acchive the necessary result the government hoped for.

Therefore, the Government agree and follow the Conservative Party's solution to reduce state interference in this matter and let each citizens decide on their appropiate option for tattoo service.

## Debate on Senerean's Vote in Security Council about Repeal "On The Supremacy Of The Potato"
2023-02-19 22:18

### The Speaker
The Security Council's resolution "Repeal "On The Supremacy Of The Potato" requested to repeals Security Council Resolution 419, "On The Supremacy Of The Potato". Senerean stands with that repeal, stating the lack of diversity in food and culture of the Security Council. Senerean was unable to vote on the Resolution 419 itself.

However the Republic of Wilhelma and the Flanfairs expressed disappointment against Senerea's vote. Furthermore, others country in the Almersen Union voted against the repeal resolution. Senrean withdrew its vote and wait for the discussion from the House of Commons.

### Conservative Party
It is necessary to keep the traddition alive. Potatoes tied with our nation's history—it's one of the food that keeps us alive during our darkest hours. It's zero flavour is a blessing, because it is a blank canvas that anybody can draw on it and shape it the way they like. Smashed potatoes, baked potatoes, boiled potatoes, you named it. Those are the tradditional food, but still able to shape its flavour according to the cook themselves. Even the famous channel "You sucks at cooking" have a video about ways to cook potatoes that inspired Senerians to bring the simplest flavour into the next level.

### Liberal Party
The Potato is a food that was agreed to be the ultimate food of the world, not Senerean. Our culture and traddition doesn't stopped at the potato: it expands to other food and cuisine that includes other possible ingredients. We are a nation of inclusiveness and diversity, and we roots from the hope of a nation for everybody. We keep our ground and stand against the Ressolution 419, because it is a resolution of discrimination and force the world to just follow one-single-supreme-food. It is trying to shoved a bland food into our throat, forced us to enjoy it, and declare it the ultimate food for the Security Council.

### Conservative Party
What the Liberal Party is suggesting is we get rid of our own traddition to follow the "collective agreement"—whatever that means. However they forgot the fact that about 70% voted fore the Resolution 419 and the majority of the world agreed on it. They also forget the fact that this Resolution will affected the entire world, and they are forcing the world to follow our inclusiveness culture! Maybe what they should consider in the first place is the majority, which is true democracy, and think of why Resolution 419 passed in the first place. 

### Liberal Party
There is a quote by Gabriel Dumout: "The truest democracy is a democracy where minority can flourish". Our vote in this matter expressed a firm statement to the world about our inclusiveness. The majority of the world thinks differently, doesn't means Senerean have to follow it! Our vote doesn't have to follow the majority, but our vote should express what our country and citizens are. By voting for this repeal, we enable others food to be tried and have an opportunity to stand for itself in this world. Moreover, this doesn't mean that the Potato won't be continued. This means that the Potato will have a fair ground with other food to be tatsed and rate by all nations

### Government: Minister of Foreign Affairs
The opinion in this House was recorded and considered. The government acknowledge the fact that there are diplomatic ties that should be kept and the majority that we should follow. However, we must imply the fact that our nation have an extremely high food quality and the inclusiveness of all culture. We must also recognize the fact that democracy means we express our nation own opinion, and our nation's valued in diversity. Lastly, we also evaluated the diplomatic damage on this decision and agreed that it won't affect Senerean's important relationship with other nations.

Therefore, we declare that Senerean will vote for the Reolution "Repeal: “On The Supremacy Of The Potato”"

# The Senerean Senate
## Debate on method of attending F2SBC conference
2023-02-19 15:00

### The Speaker
Continuing the debate from yesterday, the Head of State have a word. You have the floor.

### The Head of State
Thank you Mr. Speaker.

As I promised yesterday, I already asked for extra funding from my parents, and they granted us their secondary phone with the condition to return after that conference. This is a relief that I want to inform the Senate right away. The plan to attend that conference is going on the 16 bus like usual, then take the Skytrain to go home. That means I will have to walk the rest 600m while attending the meeting, but as the Liberal Party's recommendation, it will make me relate to nature. Of course, that also means I will join that meeting on the Skytrain and face the possibility of crowded train, but that is much safer that bringing Idea-chan with me. That also means this solution will let Idea-chan stay and home and wait for me to come back to attend the conference. One drawback of this solution that I can think of is we cannot get any information on the badminton club, but it is a slight compromise for every other benefits. With that being said, I herby declare this debate was resolved.

### The Speaker
The Debate on method of attending F2SBC conference, started on 2020-02-18 was resolved.
