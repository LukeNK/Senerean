### Speaker
The question period shall commence now. The Conversative Party have the floor.

### Conservative Party
Just in the last Parliament session, the Liberal Party reinstated their commitment to reducing tax. However, the day right after that speech, we reached the record tax rate of 68%! Despite they said that the average income increased to the record high, our average disposable income rate is now second-to-last of our Union. The Liberals are destroying our environment and our country just to fill their pocket instead of giving back to those who actually worked for it!

### Liberal Party
The Conservative is blaming us for the high tax rate, but they completely forgot what our government is providing to Senerians for free: healthcare, housing, education, basic ultilities, and free higher education. Last months, we created many unemployment organizations to provide jobs for our citizens and restarted our economy machine. Our industrial subsidization also increased to the top 10% of our Union. We promised our citizens to make our not having any debt, and we kept our promised. This is an temporary increasement for a much greater good and the long-term future.

### Environment Party
It make we laughed when the Liberal Party talked about long-term future, where yesterday they denied the bid to host the international sport event, then take money away so our citizens could not enjoy those game. They are supposed to be the left-wing party, yet somehow they literally take money from the working class and pour it into luxurious entertainment. What about the basic ultilities that our government providing? Nenerian is currently in serious supply chain problem to the point schools there have to reduce instructional time, just for children to go out and hunt! They are youths that have to work, not to buy a new phone, not to get a new hairstyle, but to put food on their table! The ultilities that the Liberal Party are providing are not the same throughout Senerean; they should've let the people decide on what and where to use their money, instead of letting the government to go on an endless speeding spree.

### Liberal Party
Mr. Speaker, the Environment Party is trying to cherry-pick what makes our party bad and down-playing our efforts. We provided for more that 99% of Senerean proper resource for basic living, and even amenities for their life. Nenerean is a territoty that is extremely far from from mainland Senerean so logistic challenges are extremely hard to solve. We did acknowledged that and offer a much generous tax rebate program in Nenerean. For the question of the effectiveness of our tax distribution: our government do believe on Keynesian theory, which I do recommend the opposition party to understand about that before starting to question the government's motive. Our government is trying to keep the cash flow, so when we subsidize the companies, we also create opportunities for our citizens. Our government ensure that every tax seners were spent carefully and constructively.

### Conservative Party
That was a nice declaration by the Liberal Party. Mr. Speaker, I would like to welcome the Liberal Party to the Parliament where we are trying to run a real nation. They didn't even follow the theory, let alone executing it the correct way. They are trying to justify the insane tax rate of our nation by saying it is good for everybody. No! It's only good for themself and feed their pocket, while citizens are struggling to even fill their tummy. We don't need explaination for the monstrosity that the government did on citizens, we need a plan! A target! A true commitment to what they will do to honestly bring the tax rate down to bellow 30% like what they said.

### Liberal Party
As we will say, the government will do everything to its best ability to decrease the tax rate. Unnecessary spending will be further trip=m down, including reducing police force and military funding, and enable many closed industry like insurance industry or beverage sales industry. Government size will also be reduce. We hope that all parties accdept this compromise as it is not to demanding on any side. 

### Speaker
There is no further question in this session, I declare this session is finished.
