            <h1>The Almersen Union aviation</h1>
            <p>As one of the prominent members of the AUAC (the Almersen Union's Aviation Council), Senerean takes the responsibility to keeping track of the Union-level protocols, includes major waypoints, airports, and Flight Information Region. Senerean also directly responsible for flight plans and statistics, which can be found here: <a href="./flightMap.html">Flight map</a></p>
            <h2>AAAC (Almersen Aviation Aerodromes Code)</h2>
            <p>
                Created as a single code to identify aerodromes from across the Union, this code is in place to ensure consistency in communication. The standard format is: <code><2-letter country code><2-letter optional code></code>. Additional country code can be reserved when necessary.<br>
                As an extension to AAAC, the AUAC also manages major waypoints/fixes that member nations expected flights to follow at large scale. These points are named with a 5-letter code.<br>
                Union Air Entry Points are expected waypoints that flights from outside the Union expected to fly through before entering the Union's airspace. These points are coded with 3 letters, the first always start with "A" follow by its relative position compare to the Union's centre. These points usually includes general guide waypoints with additional number behind to support flight planning process. For example, the waypoint <code>AWN</code>, which is to the northern side of the west of the Almersen Union, has a guide waypoint <code>AWN1</code> between Ballinngs and Ninoarura.
            </p>
            <h2>Flight plans</h2>
            <p>
                Even before opening an international flight route, airlines must submit their general flight plans to the AUAC. The Council will then give additional recommendations for the airlines before approving it. After being approved, the plan will then be registered into the opensource Senerean's database that everybody can access.<br>
                The flight plan are usually written down as plain text with the waypoints. When flying, esentially the pilot just follow those waypoints until they reached the destination. For example, the plan: <code>EINA-SEKAI-EINV-ESAT</code> can be decoded as follow:
                <ol>
                    <li>Take off at Ninoarura International Airport</li>
                    <li>Cross the fix SEKAI</li>
                    <li>Cross Nuvak Internationa Airport</li>
                    <li>Land in Estica</li>
                </ol>
                This is considered to be a completed route and airplanes can go in both direction, but the plans registered in the system usually concern with the out-going direction only. In some case (notably Wilhelma), to ensure safety, the Council also track domestic flights between two major international airports of a nation.

            <h2>Street convention</h2>
            <p>
                - Street surface shall be more than 3-block wide
                - Direction are restricted to multiple of 45 degree
                - Basic street design:

            <p>
                - Suface marking must use smooth quartz
                - One dot for a lane means caution. In an intersection, only one high-demand direction shall be caution, while others shall be yield/stop.
                - If it is possible for left turning in the middle of the intersection, there shall be a dot there.

            <h2>Standard:</h2>
            <p>
                - First line is the name, second line will be the type (ave, st)
                - Name is capitalize, but not the type of the road
                - Third line is blank space in case the name is too long
                - Forth line will contain a simple compass navigation
                example:
            </p>
            <code>
                SEA CLIFF
                ave
                [blank space]
                <-N S->
                In case it is a split
                N SEA CLIFF ave

                - Use glow ink sack and spruce sign
                - The sign should have the background light as mild blue
                - The rotation of the sign shouldn't be matter, but prefer facing at confusing intersections
                - In an avenue intersection, the sign is at the middle of the road, and raised by smooth stone to be horizontal at eye level if necessary
                - In a street intersection, the sign is located at the corner of the intersection, raised by 3 blocks from the street level using spruce fence
