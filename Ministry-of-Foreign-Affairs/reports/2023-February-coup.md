## 2023 February Coup for Almersen Union World Assembly delegate plan
2023-02-05

### Background
Since the creation of the Almersen Union, Olfasgesvet was elected to the World Assembly (WA) delegate representing the Union. However, unsatisfied with the lack of transparency in the WA vote by Olfasgesvet, Senerean decided to stage a coup to change the delegate to Senerean.

### Plan
The Head of State will contact the Principality of Miaruko to plan for Miaruko's application to WA while convincing the Principality of Ballinngs to join the plan and revoke their endorsement with the Gavenaantrekken of Olfasgesvet. All of the listed nations will be asked to only endorse Senerean. With a clear win over the endorsement, Senerean will be the WA delegate for the Union. 

In preparation for the possible uprising by the Republic of Wilhelma and the Flanfairs, Senerean prepared to offer a Russian roulette duel with Olfasgesvet to decide on the WA delegate of the Union.

The plan will be executed by the Head of State and the Prime Minister, with the support of the Ministry of Foreign Affair. The best interest of this plan is to keep it a secret before starting the full coup, in order to prevent Wilhelma and the Flanfairs, and Olfasgesvet to take action against the coup.

2023-02-06

### Background
While executing the plan, the Prime Minister decided to contact the Dictatorship of Top Notched North Korea in order to safely secure the WA delegate position. 

### Rushed execution
Top Notched North Korea ceased to exist during that period, but the Prime Minister was able to convince the leader of that nation to revive the nation.

However, during the communication, the leader of Top notched North Korea exposed the information to Wilhelma and the Flanfairs. It is still unconfirmed by Senerean Intelligence Service if it was intentional or not.

The Prime Minister immediately call out for a full coup execution. However, because there is a delay when applying to be WA, Top Nothched North Korea and Miaruko were unable to participate in the plan right away, while Ballinngs and Senerean immediately revoke its endorsement for Olfasgesvet. 

### Current situation
The Republic of Wilhelma and the Flanfairs currently is the nation with the most endorsement, so by default becomes the WA delegate for the Union. Wilhelma and the Flanfairs immediately take action against the coup by changing the region password and removing the border control authority of Ballinngs and Senerean. It further revoked its endorsement of Senerean. Senerean indirectly challenged Olfasgesvet to a duel and revoke its endorsement to Wilhelma and the Flanfairs.

*Senerean indirect challenge statement*

A public statement was made by the Prime Minister to request for Wilhelma and the Flanfairs' endorsement again. The statement citing Senrean would be a more competent candidate for WA delegate and overwhelming support for Senerean is a sign of democracy.
> What kind of founder refused to uphold the democratic value of this Union? Wilhelma and the Flanfairs\
> Right now, we are simply giving back the power to the people, to true democracy! I'm pointing out to other nations that the true guidance, rights, and freedoms lie in Senerean! Instead of getting in the way of democracy, Wilhelma and the Flanfairs can support what others want and endorse Senerean to elect this beautiful country to become the World Assembly Delegate representing the Union. Our economy is only below the Founder of this Union, and other important aspects are either top 1 or 2. Don't you want to let a nation with those statistics lead our Union to reach the top of the world? Please I once again ask the Founder of this Union to endorse Senerean. Thank you.

*Senerean request for the Founder's endorsement*

The Executive Branch of Senerean is currently considering if Wilhelma and the Flanfairs will be the suitable WA delegate for the Union and if further actions are needed.
