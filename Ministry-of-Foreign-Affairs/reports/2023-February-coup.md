## 2023 February Coup for Almersen Union World Assembly delegate plan
2023-02-05

### Background
Since the creation of the Almersen Union, Olfasgesvet was elected to the World Assembly (WA) delegate representing the Union. However, unsatisfied with the lack of transparency in the WA vote by Olfasgesvet, Senerean decided to stage a coup to change the delegate to Senerean.

### Plan
The Head of State will contact the Principality of Miaruko to plan for Miaruko's application to WA while convincing the Principality of Ballinngs to join the plan and revoke their endorsement with the Gavenaantrekken of Olfasgesvet. All of the listed nations will be asked to only endorse Senerean. With a clear win over the endorsement, Senerean will be the WA delegate for the Union. 

In preparation for the possible uprising by the Republic of Wilhelma and the Flanfairs, Senerean prepared to offer a Russian roulette duel with Olfasgesvet to decide on the WA delegate of the Union.

The plan will be executed by the Head of State and the Prime Minister, with the support of the Ministry of Foreign Affair. The best interest of this plan is to keep it a secret before starting the full coup, in order to prevent Wilhelma and the Flanfairs, and Olfasgesvet to take action against the coup.

## 2023 February Coup: February 6th report
2023-02-06

### Background
While executing the plan, the Prime Minister decided to contact the Dictatorship of Top Notched North Korea in order to safely secure the WA delegate position. 

### Rushed execution
Top Notched North Korea ceased to exist during that period, but the Prime Minister was able to convince the leader of that nation to revive the nation.

However, during the communication, the leader of Top notched North Korea exposed the information to Wilhelma and the Flanfairs. It is still unconfirmed by Senerean Intelligence Service if it was intentional or not.

The Prime Minister immediately call out for a full coup execution. However, because there is a delay when applying to be WA, Top Nothched North Korea and Miaruko were unable to participate in the plan right away, while Ballinngs and Senerean immediately revoke its endorsement for Olfasgesvet. 

### Current situation
The Republic of Wilhelma and the Flanfairs currently is the nation with the most endorsement, so by default becomes the WA delegate for the Union. Wilhelma and the Flanfairs immediately take action against the coup by changing the region password and removing the border control authority of Ballinngs and Senerean. It further revoked its endorsement of Senerean. Senerean indirectly challenged Olfasgesvet to a duel and revoke its endorsement to Wilhelma and the Flanfairs.

*Senerean indirect challenge statement*

A public statement was made by the Prime Minister to request for Wilhelma and the Flanfairs' endorsement again. The statement citing Senrean would be a more competent candidate for WA delegate and overwhelming support for Senerean is a sign of democracy.
> What kind of founder refused to uphold the democratic value of this Union? Wilhelma and the Flanfairs\
> Right now, we are simply giving back the power to the people, to true democracy! I'm pointing out to other nations that the true guidance, rights, and freedoms lie in Senerean! Instead of getting in the way of democracy, Wilhelma and the Flanfairs can support what others want and endorse Senerean to elect this beautiful country to become the World Assembly Delegate representing the Union. Our economy is only below the Founder of this Union, and other important aspects are either top 1 or 2. Don't you want to let a nation with those statistics lead our Union to reach the top of the world? Please I once again ask the Founder of this Union to endorse Senerean. Thank you.

*Senerean request for the Founder's endorsement*

The Executive Branch of Senerean is currently considering if Wilhelma and the Flanfairs will be the suitable WA delegate for the Union and if further actions are needed.

## 2023 February coup: third-day exchanges
2023-02-07

All of the following exchanges were sent on the Union's public forum, except when stating otherwise.

### Response to Senerean's endorsement request
> What a sad sight this is. It is rather ironic that one of our Members of this Union, The Republic of Senerean, came here to this forum of the people and spoke about democracy, while he and his co-conspirators today had orchestrated, by his own admission, nothing short of an attempted coup d'état, and then proceeded to hide behind the façade of defending democratic values and used it to his defense. This is truly deplorable. He broke a long-standing tradition of this Union where the WA Delegate is agreed upon beforehand on and by the advice and consent of all Members, and then all Members would unanimously cast their endorsements for the Delegate-elect, to avoid the exact sort of thing that transpired today. By silently coordinating a series of withdrawals of endorsements and castings of endorsements to selfishly consolidate his power without prior notice to Members of this Union for approval, he threw this Union into disunity and chaos, he brought instability and fear to the people of this Union. Fortunately, timely emergency measures were taken, including the closure of border crossings, to preserve the integrity of this Union. I would like to reassure Members that, when the situation is normalized, I will timely restore order to before today's attack on democracy, and plans will be drawn for electoral laws for the seat of WA Delegate to further ensure the integrity of the office, and the peaceful transfer of power. I now urge that all parties remain calm to work towards a common resolution.

### Senerean Ministry of Foreign Affairs letter to the President of the Union
```md
# From: Government of Senerean, Ministry of Foreign Affair
# To: Wilhelma and the Flanfairs
To the Founder of this Union, of this stunningly beautiful region.
Senerean respect your power as much as the true democracy that we are talking about. We also believe that choosing the right WA delegate is important and believe that you are trying your best to keep this Union together.
However, we also believe that Olfasgesvet isn’t the correct representative. While planning this uprising, many participating nations agreed to revoke their endorsement of Olfasgesvet but were reluctant to do the same thing with the Union President. Senerean in particular was saddened by Wilhelma and the Flanfairs' statement about our peaceful nation. Senerean does not have the intention to fight against WA delegate or democracy, but we are hoping we could raise attention to the lack of a proper way to serve democracy. Our nation has one of the highest statistics in integrity, how could we do such a monstrosity?
That’s why as a settlement for this coup, we decided to put a stop to this coup with some terms attached to it. We are open to discussion if you feel unsatisfied with our resolution. Our terms to stop this coup are:
- allowing member nations to endorse or revoke their endorsement of any nation at any time without sanction or punishment, or allowing recall referendum on the WA delegate;
- all previous positions of nations participating in this coup, and were punished because of this coup, shall be restored; and
- an election shall be invoked immediately to elect the WA delegate representing this Union.
We believe that the terms we are suggesting aren't that harsh because it is honestly what this coup wants to achieve. We hope Wilhelma and the Flanfairs will quickly agree to the terms of our settlement and successfully bring democracy and prosperity to our Union.

Sincerely,
Senerean Ministry of Foreign Affairs

### President of Union's criticizing Senerean and public statement
> The Member is clearly living in a fantasy world of his own creation where he is the glorious leader of a still ongoing revolution for liberty and democracy. The opposite is true. The coup has been ended. The attempt of the usurpers has been foiled. We do not need, and will not negotiate with the terrorists to restore order, since we have restored order with the reinstatement of the original WA delegate. On the subject of the election of the Delegate, as outlined in my previous statement, electoral laws will be introduced and an election will be duly held. However, we will not bow to the unlawful rioters; the laws will be drafted by free nations without intimidation or under the terms of those seeking to destroy the integrity of this Union. Should the need arise, I would like to inform and reassure our Members that I am in possession of intelligence that would incriminate Senerean as the leader of the coup d’état, which may be used to expel the Member if extraordinary circumstances require such action to be taken. Obviously it goes without saying that we do not want such thing to be the cause of a violent breakup of this Union, so I once again urge all Members to remain cooperative and calm.

### Senerean debate against the President of the Union
> How long would it take for you to introduce electoral laws? A day? A month? A year? FOREVER? I can trust you, the Founder of this Union, but I don't trust Olfasgesvet How many times Olfasgesvet voted in WA to represent our Union, without even saying a word to everybody? Where is transparency? Where is integrity there? Every second this nation holds the WA Delegate position is a second our Union strays further from the correct path! I respect the Founder of this Union, but you took the evidence illegally. <u>History Has Its Eyes on You</u>. I'm sure that you can bend the truth to whatever you like, but just think of the later generation! <u>Who Lives? Who Dies? Who Tells Your Story?</u>.
>
> <u>**Outside the roleplay thing:**</u> All the underlined song titles are from Hamilton and are extremely good. Listen to them if possible.

### President of the Union response
> Yea I am also sure that the people will listen to someone who has just attempted to overthrow a rightfully elected official lecturing about electoral legislation. If there exists any distrust in the current Delegate, the Member should have done the right thing by publicly and transparently raising the issue with other Members for further discussion and a possible election of a new Delegate, instead of staging a coup. I would also like to take this opportunity to clarify to Members that plans for electoral laws will have been drawn up by the end of this week. Further adjustments will be announced in due course and Members may freely raise their concerns and suggestions regarding the electoral laws. Thank you.

### Olfasgesvet additional statement
> i usually vote when most of the region has voted and vote in favor of the majority soooo yes 👉👈

### President of the Union statement on Senerean's action
> Whether or not the Delegate has followed the proper procedure in voting on WA resolutions does not change the fact that the Member of The Republic of Senerean staged an unlawful coup in an attempt to consolidate his power, and that such action is unacceptable under all circumstances. I would also like to address the Member’s claim that my evidence was obtained illegally. Firstly, as of present there exists no standard of evidence in this Union that strictly applies to proceedings in this Union. Secondly, no judicial proceeding is taking place, so any standards of evidence do not apply. Thirdly, this cannot be considered “evidence”, this is intelligence obtained by our agencies for non judicial purposes, and therefore no standards of evidence apply. And finally, the intelligence was voluntarily surrendered to us in the first place without any provocation from us.

### Senerean argues against the President's statement
> Our source states otherwise. You apparently outright stole the information source (aka the phone) without consent and kept it as if it is your procession. However, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers it is currently a good idea to suspend this debate because our Head of State needs to write an English assignment and he keeps checking Nationstates to debate with you.

> P.S: PLEASE DON'T CONTINUE DEBATING I BEG YOU I WROTE MORE FOR THIS MATTER THAN WHAT I WROTE FOR MY ENTIRE ENGLISH 11 CLASS AND I DON'T WANT TO GET A C FOR ENGLISH 12 THANK YOU LOVE Y'ALL.

### Olfasgesvet account dispatch: The Provisional ‘Republic’ under Burmonesder
This dispatch can be found [here](https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1834136).

> Recently, Olfasgesvet/Fasgetland was overthrown by a military coup and instituted a “democratic republic”, which was in reality: a military dictatorship.
In the first day of Sergeant Burmonesder’s regime, he held a speech in Neu Storligstad Square stating his admiration towards the ideals of nationalism and authoritarianism, which started an instant riot in the square. This riot resulted to citizens picking up stones from the nearby park and throwing them at the balcony on which Burmonesder stood on. He was quickly evacuated through a helicopter before the crowd stormed the building. He was evacuated to a government residence a few cities away and resided there for 2 days before returning to the capital.
>
> Burmonesder and his armed loyalist group rounded up around 2,000 ethnically Merdese people from the Merdenia province of west Olfasgesvet. He and hsi army proceeded to do a mass shooting on the people while they were blindfolded and had done other horrible acts, including hanging the children, doing the done did doo dang with the women ILLEGALLY!!, and taking a bit fat poopy stinky on the men’s faces along with his men. Fortunately, 12 merdenites escaped and fleed outside the country.
>
> During another speech in the Neu Storligstad square, there was a group of 26 armed citizens breaking in the building by the back and stormed the building. Once again, Burmonesder was quickly evacuated before the insurgence could catch up. When he was evacuated, the insurgency went on to the speech balcony and replaced the flag of the dictatorship on the walls with the 2 old flag of Olfasgesvet, the Flower flag of the old Commonwealth of Fasgetland and the flag of the Overseas Territory of Fasgetland, being signs of support to return to a better state, being under Olafiland.
>
> Later the day, Olafiland caught wind of the situation and started to conduct a mobilization of a small military force, preparing for a search for Burmonesder.
>
> Burmonesder was said to have escaped to Senerean, staying there for a few days before the Olafi Royal Guard conducted an operation in suspected areas where he could've been hiding. Burmonesder was later found hiding in a bunker with 3 armed loyalists. What ensued was an hour long shootout between Burmonesder and his men and a team of 6 soldiers.
>
> Burmonesder was eventually captured and put on trial, ending the short-lived military dictatorship and it’s leader. Burmonesder is said to be executed today, being charged with genocide and war crimes.
> 
> Now, the government is restored, Olafiland is back, and people are happy.

### Senerean Prime Minister replies to Olfasgesvet's dispatch
This reply was made on Discord.

> Thank you for your report\
> No wonder, because just recently a person came into the Prime Minister's office, suggesting to create the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His speech was so passionate that the Prime Minister decided to create it right away. He was able to influence the entire government, leading us into this dark violent path. Because of this incident and your report, the Parliament will create the Ministry of Internal Affairs to investigate this matter.\
> To compensate for our error, the Government of Senerean will offer international healthcare and education aid to countries with citizens living in poor conditions. Furthermore, this incident will be documented in detail and available for public.
