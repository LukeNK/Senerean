## Territorial Disputes on the Island of Balling Baller
2023-08-21

### Timeline
On 2023-08-13, The Principality of Ballinngs published the following statement after the Olfasgesvet's statement to request the entrance of Balling Baller:

> To the respected members of Olafi Empire's Ministry of Internal and External Affairs, represented by the Secretary-General Olfasgesvet,
> 
> We are absolutely glad to hear that the colony of Balling Baller has been restored and saved from desertion. However, on the eve of the colony's return to the Union, from within Ballinngs has developed a movement, and after careful consideration, our government has deemed it rightful and plausible to carry out its demand.
> 
> We the people of Ballinngs, namesake of the legendary sport, has always been attached to our nationality and identity as a ball loving culture. Or to put it simply, we do be "Balling". We are the center of balling, the home of Ballers and rich in balls. Therefore any Baller, wherever they are, always look up to the Ballinngs metropole, and long for the day when they can return to the motherland.
> 
> Ever since the settlement of native Ballers on the Balling Baller islands from the ancient times, the culture there are inherent of a balling civilization. This is not much of a surprise considering how close the islands are geographically to the Ballinngs mainland. In fact, most of the inhabitants are either descended from the first Balling settlers, or came in the second wave of migration from the mainland for business and trading opportunities. Only a tiny part of the population are of Fasgeter origin, in administrative and governmental roles. We appreciate the contribution of Fasgeters, and the role of the Empire in the prosperity of the colony. But this is the present, and colonialism is outdated. We do not oppose against colonial holdings in the Union, but the minority-rule situation in the colony are not favorable for the citizens of the islands. It's time for the Ballers to decide Ballers' fate.
> 
> Additionally, considering the geographical distance between the closest territory of Imperial Olafi in the union, Genadie and Balling Baller, the Empire giving up one small territory isolated by ocean will undeniably save cost to administrate and maintain garrison on the islands. Furthermore, the current economy of Balling Baller are pale compared to its mercantile past, and will not significantly impact the economy of the empire as a whole.
> 
> Therefore, with overwhelming support from citizens of both mainland Ballinngs and Balling Baller, we the Balling people, nation and Ballers from across the world, would like to request a handover of all territory and authority of the Balling Baller colony in whole, under the Olafi Empire, to the state of Ballinngs.
> 
> Nevertheless, all of these are not enough for such sudden and radical idea to sprout up inside Ballers, without another unacceptable detail of the colony. Ballers, the inhabitants of the islands themselves, are listed as the national animal of the land where they live. It is absolutely unreasonable to say that it is a prestigious title when the people are listed at the same level as animals. On behalf of Ballers everywhere, this is deeply insulting, and we demand the immediate removal of the title, as well as an official apology from the current Balling Baller administration. However, the damage has already been done, and the request to transfer the colony to Ballinngs remains as the main purpose of this message.
> 
> If the handover is successful, we will ensure the safety and fair treatment of Fasgeter inhabitants of the colony, and they will retain their citizenship of Balling Baller, if they choose to remain on the islands. The current colonial government will be replaced by an election, however former government officials are not barred from entering the election. If they choose to leave the colony, we will not obstruct any movement, but the Empire will decide on how to handle emigrants if they come to Imperial territory.
> 
> Further details of the handover are to be discussed later, but the government has already devised a procedure to ensure a peaceful transition. As we are open to more negotiation about the matter, we will accept a meeting between leaders of the two states, or any kind of tribunal the Union has assembled to resolve this matter. We want to avoid any military confrontation at all cost, but if our demands are not met, we cannot guarantee that our military will stay idle.
> 
> We hope that the Olafi government acknowledges our request, and consider the terms wisely and carefully.
> 
> From the Ballinngs MFA, on behalf of our nation and people.

Initially, the Senerean considered having an official position on the issue, but with the recommendation of the Parliament and the Government of the Wilhelma, the Head of State wait for further statement before proceed, to which the Government of The Republic of Wilhelma and the Flanfairs published:

> To the Secretary-General Olfasgesvet,
> 
> In light of recent developments as raised by the Honorable Member for Ballinngs, we express our deepest concerns over threats to our regional peace and stability. It is our stance that any discord be resolved by peaceful means through the Union's institution. Therefore, we request that the Grand Assembly be convened at once to discuss and hopefully work toward a resolution for a peaceful end to this conflict.
> 
> The Minister of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Government of The Republic of Wilhelma and the Flanfairs

The Government of Senerean endorse the peace-making message by liking it in the message board. Due to the distance to Ballinngs and Balling Baller to Senerean, the Prime Minister open a closed meeting with all of the Ministers to discuss the possible course of action for the government about this issue. Olfasgevet then made a statement regarding the matter:

> To: The Almersen Union\
> From: The Foreign Office of Olfasgesvet
> 
> With the developments made by Ballinngs about the restoration of Balling Baller, its membership to the Almersen Union, and reincorpation to the Olafi Empire, we wish to inform you all that we will leave these matters to be resolved by the Imperial Council and the Grand Chancellery of Olafiland, the Overseas and Colonial Ministry of Olafiland, and his majesty, Emperor Gustaf I.

This statement is considered to be agressive in Senerean point of view. The statement implies that Balling Baller doesn't have it own self-governing status but rather replies on the Imperial Council for decision-making. However, Senerean only published its statement on 2023-08-14 after eyewitnesses report (speculations) about Ballinngs' army mobilization. An official bilingual statement was quickly composed and released:

> To the Secretary-General,
> 
> The message made by Ballinngs raised concern in our people over the region's security and safety, and the Senerian Government supports the President's statement to resolve this matter peacefully. We hope the Grand Assembly and nations involved can settle Ballinngs' request democratically and rightfully.
> 
> Have a nice evening,
> The Senerian Government.

The message was quickly responded by Ballinngs:

> ̶h̶i̶ ̶w̶e̶ ̶a̶r̶e̶ ̶s̶e̶n̶d̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶m̶a̶n̶d̶o̶s̶ ̶o̶v̶e̶r̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶b̶a̶l̶l̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶b̶a̶l̶l̶e̶r̶ ̶n̶o̶w̶
> -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> 
> Please do not be alarmed. Above is an unintended message from a rogue commander of our Marine Brigade. We have promptly arrested and removed him from his post. Rest assured, our military is not mobilized.
> 
> To affirm our willingness to pursue further negotiations to resolve the Balling Baller question, our cabinet has proposed several options as to proceed with the handover arrangement. Following the minor mutiny in our central command, we will not continue to seek the for the complete annexation of the Balling Baller colony, rather:
> - A joint administration scheme, and/or
> - A transition period, only after which Balling Baller are handed over to Ballinngs, but under the status of an "Autonomous Community", where both Baller and Olafi culture are promoted as equals.
> 
> These options are desirable to us, the government as well as the Balling people. We hope that representatives of the Empire also feel the same way, and let us succeed in developing a peaceful resolution to the dispute.
> 
> We will also acknowledge any suggestions and orders from the honorable Grand Assembly of the Union, assembled for this matter.
> 
> From the Ballinngs MFA, on behalf of our leader and the Foreign Cabinet.

After that message, the Kingdom of Estica prompty present its Drafted Peaceful Resolution to the Grand Assembly. According to sources, this message is a collaboration between Estica and Wilhelma and the Flanfairs for 3 days during the escalation.

The message, however, sparks public outcries in Senerean, especially for people who are Balling Baller descendants. Protests were arranged outside of the Parliament demands Senerean to step in to maintain its role in peacekeeping. The Head of State office quickly publish its opinion on the Drafted Peaceful Resolution:

> To the General Assembly of the Union,
> 
> On the Topic of Territorial Disputes on the Island of Balling Baller and Estica's Drafted Peaceful Resolution
> 
> We, Senerean, respectfully disagree with Estica. An itemized list would be appropriate to address the issue in their drafted resolution, but acknowledging the endorsement from the President, allow us to direct our attention to the daily life of an average citizen on the Island of Balling Baller.
> 
> We understand this is the dispute over the control of the Island of Balling Baller, but the daily life of citizens will be affected drastically if the island is divided into two. Families will be separated, for that is the obvious fact. Can you now imagine how many parents' promises are broken, because now, they must tell their children that crossing the island requires you to go through a ten-kilometre strip of land that was put into place because two governments decided so? What about the water body where multiple fishers and lives depend on crossing it daily? The establishment of the buffer zone can be considered similar to the Berlin Wall which separated many people from each other; we refrain to use Korea's DMZ as an example because of the obvious political separation that happen before the DMZ, but Balling Baller itself is a united island with no prior separation. This sudden implementation of the plan is deemed unexpected by the Senerian Government, and we believe the people of Balling Baller also think the same thing.
> 
> Moreover, it has come to our knowledge that the political freedom of Balling Baller is considered to be excellent by the World Census. World Census is an independent organization that is trusted around the NationStates by many nations so we believe that the Grand Assembly should give that information necessary burden. That is a fact, so the Senerean government believes that the current elected government of Balling Baller can speak for the citizens on the island. Moreover, the island also installed a public protest policy, and elections are free and open to all citizens. We hope that information can give the Grand Assembly an insight into the current situation on the island; such information already prompted Senerean to seek more information from Balling Baller, but we cannot act by ourselves. We understand that this matter happens outside our border, therefore we can only ask the Grand Assembly to inquire for more information on the government of Balling Baller and their opinion on the drafted Peaceful Resolution. Nevertheless, such an important matter requires direct input from the citizens. The Senerian Government highly suggests the Grand Assembly organize a public referendum on the matter that is open for all citizens of Balling Baller.
> 
> In a few words, this message suggests that the Grand Assembly:
> - considers and assesses the situation for the citizens on the island of Balling Baller;
> - re-evaluates the possible consequence of Estica's Drafted Peaceful Resolution, specifically the planned buffer zone;
> - examine the government transparency as well as the political freedom in Balling Baller; and
> - organize a public referendum following the Instant Runoff System on the matter, listing clearly the options for citizens as well as which government suggested it.
> 
> Finally, the Senerian Government wishes for a peaceful and democratic resolution to the territorial disputes. We hope that by creating a simple-worded and straightforward message, we can create a comfortable and productive environment for the three governments to orderly resolve this matter and satisfy the citizens. We hope that the Grand Assembly prioritizes the need of the disputed territory's citizens and considers it to be the first concern when coming up with a solution.
> 
> We wish everybody a nice day and peace be with them,
> The Head of State of the Senerian Government, on behalf of the Government of Senerean.

The message asked for a much more lenient approach to the situation, considers the affect of the Drafted Resolution on daily lives, and ask for a different approach to the governing status of Balling Baller. Senerean begs to differ from the Ressolution and hope that citizens from all Member Nations of the Union can stand up for a much peaceful solution to the disputes. The President of the Almersen Union, however, endorses the Drafted Peaceful Resolution.

> To: The Grand Assembly
> Subject: Statement to the Grand Assembly in support of the draft resolution submitted by Estica regarding the territorial disputes of the island of Balling Baller
> 
> Mr. Secretary-General Olfasgesvet,
> 
> Distinguished Members,
> 
> Ladies and Gentlemen,
> 
> We stand before this esteemed assembly today with a profound commitment to fostering peace, stability, and cooperation within our region and beyond. The Republic of Wilhelma and the Flanfairs hold the principles of the Almersen Union Charter in high regard, understanding that the pursuit of peaceful solutions to disputes is paramount for the collective well-being of all nations.
> 
> We come forward in full support of the draft resolution put forth to address the longstanding territorial disputes on the island of Balling Baller. This resolution embodies the essence of diplomacy, cooperation, and compromise - values that resonate deeply with our nations.
> 
> We believe that the proposal to divide the island into two halves, administered by the Principality of Ballinngs and the Kingdom of Olafiland respectively, is a just and pragmatic solution. This arrangement acknowledges the legitimate concerns and aspirations of both parties, offering them the opportunity to exercise their sovereignty and maintain peaceful coexistence.
> 
> Furthermore, the establishment of a buffer zone, to be administered by Almersen Union Peacekeeping Forces, exemplifies the international community's dedication to upholding peace and security. The AUPF's presence will be a symbol of unity and a safeguard against potential hostilities, ensuring the stability of the region for generations to come.
> 
> We, however, recognize that the draft resolution as it currently stands is flawed in certain aspects and do wish that certain amendments be made to the draft resolution before it goes before the Assembly for a vote. In order to secure the rights of the people of Balling Baller, regardless of which side of the border they might be on, we put forward the following suggestions and conditions for Wilhelma and the Flanfairs to approve the aforementioned draft resolution.
> 
> We propose that:
> 
> (a) an independent Almersen Union-backed commission be established with the task of determining the line of division so that it reflects, to the greatest extent, the different nationalities and affiliations of the population on the ground in order to avoid any possible conflicts on such grounds;
> 
> (b) the freedom of movement of the residents of the island between the two divisions, regardless of their nationality or affiliation, is secured and guaranteed; and
> 
> (c) a mechanism be included so that the people of any division of the island may call for a sovereignty referendum to retain their current political status, transfer the whole island to either Ballinngs or Olafiland, or declare the whole island an independent country. The results of such referendums will be put into effect if the proposed measure receives the approval of the majority of voters in each division respectively and of the whole island in total.
> 
> As the Republic of Wilhelma and the Flanfairs, we commend the Principality of Ballinngs and the Kingdom of Olafiland for their willingness to engage in this diplomatic process and work towards a lasting solution. We believe that this resolution not only represents a positive step forward for Balling Baller but also sets a precedent for conflict resolution that can inspire hope and collaboration across the globe.
> 
> We express our gratitude to the Almersen Union and all member states for their commitment to promoting peace and security. We call upon all nations to support this resolution, reaffirming the strength of the international community's resolve to address disputes through dialogue and peaceful means.
> 
> In conclusion, the Republic of Wilhelma and the Flanfairs firmly stand behind the draft resolution before us. We believe that its adoption will usher in a new era of harmony and cooperation on the island of Balling Baller and beyond. Let us seize this opportunity to demonstrate the power of unity and diplomacy in building a better world for all.
> 
> Thank you, Mr. Secretary-General.
> 
> The Minister of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of Wilhelma and the Flanfairs

The Dominion of Olafasgesvet published its statement, once again implies what many Senerians called "disgusting colonialism mindset" message.

> From: The National Office of Communication, relaying a message from the Imperial Council\
> To: Ballinngs
> 
> The Imperial Council has decided that we will keep the Colony under Olafi Administration and control, though we will concede minor territories that are majority Baller culture and still follow what we deem “Baller practices”, compared to many Ballers that have been assimilated and/or converted to Olafi culture and Catholicism (our state religion).
> 
> Thank you.

The lastest and most recent message was published by Ballinngs:

> To the honored Olfasgesvet, representative of the Imperial Council in the Union,
> 
> Not regarding territorial issues, we remain adamant that at least, the archipelago be controlled jointly by both Olafi and Ballinngs, through (technical details: nation sharing), or better yet come under full Ballinngs control. Otherwise it would have failed the initial plea of the Balling Baller movement that had arisen in the first place. However, we recognize the importance of the colony to the integrity and stability of the Empire, along with many islander's will to remain with Olafi, so with that,
> 
> We would like to express our message to the esteemed Grand Assembly:
> 
> The Ballinngs government are happy to settle on a dual-administration treaty with the Empire, with its terms and conditions decided by the Assembly, of which we suggest a few such as:
> - Changes in policies are able to be enacted from both sides, except those that drastically affects the colony's fundamental principles of human rights, such as freedom of speech and expression, rights to vote, et cetera.
> - (Technical) Immutable nation descriptions and naming schemes, unless agreed on to permit changes by both sides, supervised by a special committee of the Union.
> - And any other conditions outlined by the Assembly.
> 
> On the subject of territorial disputes, we acknowledges and expresses our gratitude to the contributions of the Grand Assembly on suggesting possible resolutions to resolve the dispute over the colony. However, our aim as of now has shifted from annexation of parts of the colony, to being a representative for Baller residents currently inhabiting the islands.
> 
> As pointed out by the honorable member Senerean, a division of territory along the islets will be, if not catastrophic, damaging to relations between communities on the colony, both Balling and Olafi. Moreover, creating a buffer zone between the islands would be unfavorable and take much effort, due to the territory of the colony being comprised of multiple islets mostly of small size, whereas it would be much more reasonable to do the same thing for an island of larger area. Therefore, we are currently not in support of the resolution to divide the colony, with the difficulties and risks that are involved in carrying out such a task.
> 
> On the religious question, we would also like to emphasize that we Ballinngs as a nation has long preferred a diverse cultural identity, rather than embracing a single state religion. This will also mean that believers of any religion inside Ballinngs will not be restricted or hindered from practicing their own religious activities, of course including Catholicism (state religion of the Olafi Empire).
> 
> Sincerely,
> The Ballinngs MFA
