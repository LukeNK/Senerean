[Text] "Taking away those brat's phones is necessary to protect the national secret in the army!", the National Defense Minister posted on his profile, "moreover, those little pieces of black magic will do nothing except distract the real men from serving our glorious nation with all their heart and soul."

[Text] "That is not far enough! We can also let the army use games as a form of training", whispers your Minister of Information, who is looking at your phone instead of the presentation, "just think of the reduced cost since we don't have to provide trainees with real guns. We should fund online tournaments where the army plays against other players to showcase our strength to the world at no cost... well except the internet cost itself... or the computers... or the headphones...", the Minister quickly jotted down a list of expenses.
