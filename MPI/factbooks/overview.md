    The Republic of Senerean, commonly called Senerean or Xenereanu, is a unitary semi-presidential republic in [region]The Almersen Union[/region]. It is usually separate into three regions: Nenerean, North Senerean, and South Senerean, and considered to have three geological represent by those three regions. Politically, Senerean is comprised of 9 provinces and 6 island clusters.

[b][u][size=150][anchor=Ety]Etymology[/anchor][/b][/u][/size]

    There isn't any official theory for the origin of [i]Senerean[/i] (and hence the word "Nenerean"). Many theories were suggested, but all of them were rejected on one or more fatal flaw. The name "Senerean" never got its official origin, but many evidences suggest that it come from the word "share" in English.

    The word "Nenerean" have the origin stem from the word "Northern Senerean", where the starting constant starting to merge. The origin of "Menerean" also developed similarly.

    A widely taught trick is that the "N" in Nenerean stands for North, while "S" stands for South in Senerean. The origin of this trick dated back to the early 1900s and constantly mentioned in the jazz culture during "the Roaring 20s". This prompts the question when Nenerean united with Senerean to make a new name for the nation; the referendum was defeated with 78% votes saying no to name changing. Despite that, the Republic of Senerean has the name Xenereanu in Milaru to signify a neutral name for the country.

[size=65]This section will be considered to move to a separate factbook due to the condensed information.[/size]

[i]Main article: [url=MAIN FACTBOOK ON HISTORY]History of Senerean[/url][/i]

[b][u][anchor=PreHist]Early history[/anchor][/u][/b]

    Much evidence suggests permanent inhabitation in Senerean started at least 15,000 years ago and constantly developing. The society structure was complex, formed along with an extensive trading network resulting in cultural exchange, making the area — despite diverse backgrounds — rather uniform in terms of urbanity. While connection is necessary, it is often considered the northern Senerean area (Nenerean region) to be isolated from the rest of the Senerean area due to extreme weather. It was discovered that a mass migration around 2,000 BCE left the Nenerean region mostly empty. However, life in Nenerean bloomed again after 500 CE in the area that is Ninuarura today to administer trading for the rest of the Almersen area to [nation=noflag]Ballinngs[/nation] and later [nation=noflag]Balling Baller[/nation].

    The main trade route that Senerian tribes usually administer follows along the western shoreline of the nation. With many village masters in boatbuilding, Senerean became a large raw material, timber wood, and wheat from the Senerean region area. It was found that Senerian merchants excelled at the economics of scale at that time using large-scale machinery to support loading to ships. However, due to a rather unfavourable current heading, many ship's loads were limited by the strength of the rowers rather than the technology of the ship itself.

    Despite strong connections between tribes, there is no administrative body above the Chiefs. The closest to a national government that was established at that time was the Assembly, which comprised village/tribe chiefs from the area. The Assembly may have comprised chiefs from as far as southern Estica. The meeting place was mostly chosen to be in [nation=noflag]Estica[/nation] due to the denser population, but Nuvak was sometimes chosen. The power of the Assembly at that time was mostly limited to knowledge exchange and acted more like a negotiation ground for the tribes. Some may even consider it a VIP lounge in a market.

    A change happened in Senerean after 500 CE following the developments in Ninoarura. Despite multiple speculations suggesting that Ninoarura was populous thanks to trading between Ballinngs and the rest of the nation, it was still unclear how the area became the centre of the Nenerean region. However, multiple factors including a beneficial geographical location for wood logging, fur hunting, and a pleasant climate played a large factor in the development of the area, despite the area usually being faced with earthquakes. It may be said that because at that time, permanent mega-structures were rare, the effect of earthquakes was not considerably devastating compared to today. This factor played a huge role in the development of small-size housing culture that played a huge role until this day.

    Conflicts between tribes happened in light of protecting trading interests and usually took place in the form of sanctions. Physical altercations and micro-wars also occur but are usually resolved quickly for many villages and tribes lack a self-sufficient economy. It is also notable that at the time, there was a lack of a well-defined border beyond the village perimeter. Resources beyond a village are usually considered natural and can be harvested by anybody, but tribe members only harvest the resources their tribe excels at in terms of production to increase the economy of scale as well as having the proper equipment to process it.

[b][u][anchor=ColPer]Middle Ages[/anchor][/u][/b]

    Those dynamics remained unchanged when the Grand Solomon Empire took over the land where Ballinngs, Estica, and Senerean reside today. This can be attributed to the lack of a clearly defined border to begin with in combination with a rather soft ruling by the Empire. Many tribes enjoyed the collaborative atmosphere provided by the Empire. Moreover, the lack of external threats helped with economic development.

    However, corruption results in the Grand Solomon Empire abusing its "occupation" status. This prompted the Chief Assembly to execute one of its first major decisions: establishing an army to be controlled by the Master Chief. The reason to reserve the control of the army to one single person is to ensure the speed of decision, since one Assembly meeting may take months to plan.

    Under the command of the Master Chief, the Chief Assembly quickly took control of Nuvak, the main administrative centre of the Solomon Empire over Senerean. However, the Master Chief didn't report the victory to the Assembly but instead used the loot to hire a mercenary army from the Tudor Empire. This delay proved to be crucial because many soldiers from the initial army were sent home, thinking they would be rewarded but now facing hunger and demoralized. The loot is more than enough for the mercenary to loot villages and block trading resources. Since most of the Senerean villages can't be self-sustaining, this marks the ruling of the Master Chief over Senerean starting from 1175. He called the Senerean Empire, which marks the first usage of the word "Senerean" to refer to [the] land.

    The Senerean Empire continued to be ruled by other two empresses consecutively before the War of the Four Emperors began in 1236. Sensing the danger from the mercenary, the Last Empress called for an emergency meeting with the Assembly. While having no respect for the empress, the Assembly decided to meet with the empress in fear of being invaded. The meeting happened in Ninoarura, with the Empire ship picking up many Chiefs along the coastal area. Meanwhile, the Tudor Empire "officially" declared war on the Senerean simply by delivering the mail to the mercenary, to which never reached the officials of the Senerean Empires.

    Learning from the last time, the Assembly decided to appoint three Master Chiefs to fight on three different fronts: Ballinngs, Tudor (Estica), and Solomon. While many were afraid that the Last Empress might continue her atrocities, it is undeniable that her strategic skills are vital, therefore the Last Empress was kept inland to act as a general commander.

    The war dragged on for 12 years until 1248, when the war suddenly ended with the perish of the Grand Solomon Empire as well as Senerean signing a peace treaty with the Tudor Empire. The Tudor-Senerean peace treaty was being administered by the Last Empress. After it was signed, the Last Empress was never to be seen again. Many speculate that because she has committed multiple crimes against the Assembly, the Chief decided to kill her as a form of revenge; others suggested that the Last Empress understood that she wouldn't have a proper social standing after the war, so she decided to leave the public for good. This made the Last Empress, despite with her oppression during the first few years of her rule, the symbol of integrity. Her leave also marked the end of the Senerean Empire. The Assembly, meanwhile, understood the difficulties ahead and decided to establish Senerean.

[b][u][anchor=Independence]Independence[/anchor][/u][/b]

    In 1800s, the industrial revolution along with the expansion of transportation prompt the Assembly to seek for a much more unified status accross Senerean. Many people in Nenerean, however, find themself separated from the rest of Senerean because of distance as well as a much different climate ([i]haha pun[/i]) to understand each other well. Because of that, "the Assembly" decided to separate into two areas called "Northern Senerean" and "Southern Senerean", which the first became "Nenerean" while the latter further split into two regions: Menerean and Senerean. All of the Chiefs in Southern Senerean established the Western Chief Assembly on 1865-9-12.

    During this period, the area started to being considered as a nation, but the lack of official government make it difficult to voice Senerean's concerns to the world. Therefore, tribes in the Senerean and Menerean region decided to vote for a national government to unite them all together. The Senerean Constitution was drafted and recieved all signatures on September 1872. The Senerean Parliament at that time have very little power except international diplomatic power and resolving disputes between the First Nations. This dynamic quickly changed when the Great War broke out in Europe.

    Senerean in the early 20th century was still rather isolated from the rest of the world because of the low population density and new national identity. When the tension increased in Europe, many Senerians expect the government to stay neutral in the war, which the government followed. The devastating casualty promted the government to accept refugees from all two sides of the war following the "Help the people, not the guns!" protest. This campaign showcased the international community about Senerean's high respect in civil rights and political freedom, but also recieve criticism from everybody involved in the war. Senerians were banned from travelling to many countries because of the fear Senerean may support spy activities from the enemies. Because of the reduced international trade, Senerean practice self-sufficient economy. This practice quickly stopped after the war end when Senerean's relationship with other countries are rather positive.

[b][u][anchor=PostWW1]The Roaring 20s and the World War 2[/anchor][/u][/b]

    Senerean's national government became important when international trading is necessary after the war. This area started to shape the current government structure where power were delagated mostly to the national and provincial government.

    After the first World War, Senerean economy took a turn for good when a much more liberal government was elected. The adoption of Western culture (because of the increased trade) and European culture (thanks to the lenient refugee policies) transformed Senerean into a diverse country.

    When the World War 2 broke out in Europe, Senerean once again take the neutral prosition in the international ground. The government stockpiled local manufacturing to be consumed domestically. Many dual-citizenship Senerians volunteered to fight for other nations, while medical personnels were sent to support the front lines in Europe. However, many nations reluctant to use Senerians personnels because the fear that Senerean in cooperating with the enemy. Moreover, this promotes the neutrality and pacifism of Senerean, and deters many from fighting. The political and economy situation also leads to many seek refugee in Senerean. The government offered multiple programs to let refugees seek for asylum in remote area to expand empty land of Senerean.

[b][u][anchor=PostWW2]Post-war Senerean and Nenerean Reunion[/anchor][/u][/b]

    After war, Senerean once again became the powerhouse in development thanks to the plentiful resources available after the war, exporting staples and material to other nations. The increased population also allow Senerean to expand their transportation network. Senerean excel in agriculture technology and financial section after the government shift away from fossil resources because of the foreseeable future of the depletion.

    During the war, Nenerean was rarely being considered by the international community and with an isolated position diplomatically. Citizens from both regions were frustrated because the separation politically. Many acknowledge the initial separation between two regions were drawn poorly and the separation was merely made for administration. However, the technologically allows the government to manage with much higher efficiently. The Nenerean Reunion plan begins during the World War 2, but the official status for Nenerean was still in dispute: in 1947, Nenerean joined Senerean as a territory. However, many seeks for an equal status to other provinces, to which the government decided to divide Nenerean into six provinces. At noon of 10th February, 1953, citizens in Ninoarura were invited to the Parliament hill to sign as witness for the passage of the Nenerean Reunion Act, amending the Constitution and officially finalize the proceadure to let Nenerean join the Republic after 81 years of separation.

[b][u][anchor=Coldwar]The Cold War[/anchor][/u][/b]

    During the early 20th century, Nenerean's Inuktitut dialect slowly drift away from the main Inuktitut language and become a separate language. Milaru was (and is) not an official language of Nenerean because its communication is largely limit to daily usage. Despite that, seeking for its official status and standarization is the main interest of the government during the 1960 which revolutionized the language by the creation of Department of Linguistics. The Department standarize writing style, pronunciation, as well as printing the first Milaru dictionary and textbook.

[b][u][anchor=21thcentury]The tweenty-first century[/anchor][/u][/b]

    At the turn of the century see many need development in Senerian society to promove equality and justice. In 2006, the government announced that the national ID will no longer issue with a gender, follow by issuing passports with gender mark as X (unspecified).

    In Senerean, the coastal area starting from the capital of Naxionufinixe (Nuvak) all the way to Ninoarura are constantly being challenged with tsunami and storms, along with Komanada province to endure earthquakes. Despite that, the mainland area east of the island clusters tend to be agriculture plains suitable for industrial planting.

    Most of Senerians are bilingual with English and Milaru, while there is a diverse selection for third-language with French, German, amd Japanese. Milaru tends to be the language for daily communication, while English is usually being used in formal contexts. When being asked "do you want to have only one main language of communication for Senerean?", the majority of Senerians answered "no". Other minority languages are also being used by minority groups, but a shift to Milaru threaten the existence of those language.

    Milaru is a language that was initially developed by Nenerean communities but its usage eventually become widespread around Senerean during the 1960s. The Department of Linguistics was created in 1960 to standarize Milaru, as a large amount of dialects diverted from Inuktitut makes communication unsuitable over wide community. Many changes in pronunciation, writing style, and vocabulary was made that compromise between all dialects, while still retain the simplicity in the language. It this change also expands as far as adopting words from languages like English, Japanese, French, or Vietnamese (which is a normal practice in Milaru communication, but the department officialize those words).

    Healthcare are publicly funded by all levels of the government. After Nenerean united with Senerean, many private hospitals in Nenerean are bought by the the Senerian government. Senerians healthcare system covers all of basic health sectors except over-the-counter drugs, which citizens can buy with a discount when being referred by a doctor or a health worker. In the latest government's report, they identify the drawbacks of the current system includes: high wait time, lack of coverage in remote area, and poor availability of after-hours care. Moreover, the lack of transportation vehicles means patients have to be transported to the hospital for first-admission via private cars. Because of that, multiple cars in remote provinces are required to be equipped with standard first-aid kit, and Senerians around the country must have a basic first-aid training before obtaining the driver license.

    The leading cause of death in Senerean being old age, follow by lost in the wilderness and heart disease. Senerean rank first in the general physical health of citizens in the [region]The Almersen Union[/region] with 10.82 Banana Ingested Per Day as of August 2023.

[u][b][anchor=Education][/anchor]Education[/b][/u]

[i]Main article: [url=MAIN FACTBOOK ON EDUCATION]Education in Senerean[/url][/i]

    Education in Senerean follows the K-12 curriculum and is generally divided into pre-school, primary school, and secondary school, followed by post-secondary. The Right to a Childhood stated in the Constitution requires the government to provide education until the completion of secondary school. All levels before post-secondary are publicly funded by the national and provincial government (with the curriculum being overseen by the provincal government), while universities and colleges are partially funded by the national government. Typically, a students required at least 30 hours of community service and finish a project of their choice to graduate. Moreover, students are required to submit a post-secondary plan to the local government for necessary financial support before receiving their completion certificate. Partaking in post-secondary education is not compulsory but highly recommended.

    English is the only language of instruction, but students in Senerean are required to learn Milaru up to intermediate level. Despite that, statistic shows that Senerean students mostly graduate highschool with three languages and a considerable amount finished with the completetion of four different language courses.

    Homeschooling is another important aspect in Senerean education system. Due to remote locations, more than 10% of school-age children in Senerean submit to homeschooling. When being homeschooled, students can request to have textbooks deliver to their home. During the summer, volunteer teachers will visit the student's house to administer a nation-wide test, ensuring the knowledge the student has attained during the school year. Many post-secondary institutions require homeschooled students to take a test of knowledge before approving the application. Many provinces also support online school where students can learn at home, but submit their homework online to a teacher and take tests by visiting a nearby school.

    The number of international students in Senerean is growing in the recent years but many reluctant to migrate to Senerean due to the harsh environment and high education fee. Moreover, a controversial policy by the government is imposed to make students who are under 18 must be accompanied by their parents or siblings. This policy removed the incentive to seek for international education in Senerean because many foreigners cannot afford the cost of living. Moreover, communications in Milaru can make many feel left-out in the classroom.

    [i]Provinces and Clusters of Senerean[/i]
[/center]

    Senerean is a republic comprise of 9 provinces and 6 island clusters, which usually being grouped into 3 regions: Nenerean, Menerean, and Senerean. The national government the practice of devolution, where power is substantially delegated to local authorities. Despite that, multiple sectors are being shared by both the national and provincial government. Provinces and islands cluster have the responnsibility to provide social service and administration of civil law, while funding come directly from the national government. Equalization payments are made by the national government to ensure a uniform standard of welfare. Most provinces doesn't implement income tax but citizens still subject to the national income tax.

    In any legal capacity, an island cluster's government is similar to a provincial government. Both get their power directly from the national government with equal opportunity and power. The difference came from the fact that the cluster governments used to submit to the provincial government until a clear separation was made. This separation makes sense since some clusters may have even more people than many provinces. One notable example is the East Cluster with the capital Ninoarura.

    Senerean doesn't have an army due to its pacifist policy. Despite that, citizens can join a subsidized military trainning course with no fee to acquire experience. The government is considering giving citizens the right to own guns after completing the military training.

    Senerean main diplomatic policy is to remain neutral and support humanitarian mission. This has prompted many questions about Senerean contribution (or the lack of contribution) during World War 2. Senerean portrait itself as the peacekeeper and as international arbitrator. However, many consider that Senerean's role in that position is ineffective due to its lack of power to enforce and neutral position leads to indecisive judgements.

    Senerean's culture are usually separate into Milaru sub-culture and English-language culture. Because of the low densinity in combination with highly-developed internet speed, Senerean online culture tends to be the one that defines the culture outlook to foreigners.

    The traditional culture of Senerians based on humanity and integrity where community values are highly regardded. This reflects in the government incentive in open-source and community-maintained projects with multiple funding option for an open-source project. Despite that, the Senerian culture is considered lack of symbolism and much more developed in music and literature. The inclusiveness culture of Senerean also further embedded with many traditions from other cultures being adopted by Senerians, dominantly the Japanese culture.

    Because of the extreme cold weather, winter sports are a part of the Senerian culture, especially with outdoor sports like skiing or snowboarding. Hunting used to be a part of the culture but after the ban on gun after World War 2, it had become unpopular.

    The Senerian government promotes cycling as a solution to inner-city travel, which highly supported by citizens. Because of that, Senerean tends to bid on hosting many international cycling competitions.

    Due to rough and natural terrain, off-road rallying is also popular in Senerean. Many competitions are hosted in two provinces with high mountains and rough terrains: Barinuka and Xubaxu. Unfortunately, this also contributes to illegal racing that is hard to enforce because of the large landmass.

    E-sport is officially a sport in Senerean, but it is extremely competitive locally especially rhythm games.

    The Japanese culture in general, and anime culture in particular, is considered to be widespread in Senerean. The culture started to develop in the late 1070s and at its peak in the early 2010s when the internet started to become popular. The anime's peak in 2010s can be also attributed to the release of [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku]Hatsune Miku[/url]. Recently, the VTuber culture is also been strongly integrated into Senerean.

    The Senerian government provided large business subsidization for animation studios based in Senerean, but the online working after the Covid-19 pandemic made it difficult for the government to ensure the funding is going to businesses that employ Senerians. The government is also highly supportive of arts through the "Canvas4U" campaign where citizens can draw on any governmental building with their own art, provided that it is appropriate else risk being replaced by others. The campaign is noted to be similar to that of r/place by the social media platform [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit]Reddit[/url].

    Despite unofficially, Petra Gurin is considered to be the mascot VTuber of Senerean. Likewise, Hatsune Miku is the Vocaloid mascot.

[b][u][anchor=Music]Music[/anchor][/u][/b]

    Senerian music reflects its inclusiveness. Many programs set up by the government to promote the history of music has been considered as vital in proteccting the local music industry and the culture of Senerean in general. Despite keeping tradition, Senerean mostly well known for its diverse pop music, with the majoroty being dominated by J-pop, followed by English pop music and French music. Music in Milaru tends to circulate inside the nation due to Senerean being the only country that use Milaru. Senerean parody music is also very strong, with parodies almost in bilingual. Senerean also notable with orchestra and instrumental cover of pop songs, create "a blend between the popular culture and traditions". Vocaloid and UTAU is another dominant aspect of the music industry in Senerean, with the development of UTAU is highly favorable because of Senerean's open-source principle.

    Senerian patriotic music dated back to the World War 1 era, but wasn't fully developed until the adoption of Senerean Constitution. Therefore, Senerians tends to use North American patriotic songs or create a parody of them. "This Land Is Your Land" is a US folk song that was adopted as the national athem after the adoption of the Senerean Constitution. However, the quest to a much more inclusive national anthem continues after 11 failed referendum to adopt a new anthem. The debate was thought to be settled after a long period, until 2011, when a [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGt25mv4-2Q]Japanese Google Chrome ad[/url] was uploaded with the music composed by [url=https://vocaloid.fandom.com/wiki/Kz]kz[/url]. The catchy melody soon prompt many Senerian internet users to write a petition to the Parliament asking for the adoption of the melody as the national anthem. A bilingual lyric for the anthem quickly circulated around the internet after the full version of "Tell Your World" (the original song) was released in March 2012. "You and me" ([i]"Tima nada ta"[/i]) is the name that Senerians voted for the national anthem, and it became the official Senerian anthem on July 6th (Nenerean Reunion day) that same year. The bilingual lyric is the only official lyric published by the government.
