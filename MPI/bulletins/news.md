# Senerean flu or seasonal flu?
This afternoon, the Prime Minister addressed the accusation of other Member Nations of the Alermsen Union about Senerean’s flu outbreak. 

“The public should not be feared of this flu. The government is working hard to identify the possible cause of this but so far, no Senerians have been affected by the flu. Our researchers considered this to be a seasonal flu, but we will monitor the situation closely. We once again ask our citizens to remain calm.”

The Estican government announced 26 confirmed cases this morning and 2 deaths from the Wilhelma government. Lockdown precaution was imposed by many nations while the government denies any possible outbreak.

It is undeniable that Senerians are among the healthiest citizens in the Union. Despite that, speculations arise when it comes to the government’s speed in terms of crisis management. As the next election is looming, will this just be another easy victory for the liberal government, or this flu turn out to be a failed prediction by the running party that will change the government? The answer awaits...
