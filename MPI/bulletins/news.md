# Senerean flu or seasonal flu?
This afternoon, the Prime Minister addressed the accusation of other Member Nations of the Alermsen Union about Senerean’s flu outbreak.

“The public should not be feared of this flu. The government is working hard to identify the possible cause of this but so far, no Senerians have been affected by the flu. Our researchers considered this to be a seasonal flu, but we will monitor the situation closely. We once again ask our citizens to remain calm.”

The Estican government announced 26 confirmed cases this morning and 2 deaths from the Wilhelma government. Lockdown precaution was imposed by many nations while the government denies any possible outbreak.

It is undeniable that Senerians are among the healthiest citizens in the Union. Despite that, speculations arise when it comes to the government’s speed in terms of crisis management. As the next election is looming, will this just be another easy victory for the liberal government, or this flu turn out to be a failed prediction by the running party that will change the government? The answer awaits...

# Where are the cases?
According to [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1946360]Wilhelma and the Flanfairs headlines[/url], four schools have been closed today because of Senerean's flu. However, the alleged source of the flu denies all claims and still considers the disease seasonal flu. Why is there a conflict with the reports between Senerean and the rest of the Almersen Union?

The most important answer is that Senerean is refusing to collect or allow the collection of statistics about the flu. If all cases are reported as normal flu, the lack of statistics obviously made the understanding of the flu impossible. Despite that, multiple hospitals attempted to report Senerean's flu but so far, none has reported a complete case of Senerean's flu.

"I once again reinstate my point: this is a common flu. There is a possibility that the cases being reported are being confused during the cross-checking data since Senerean has found no death from flu alone, let alone the 'Senerean's flu' that people are talking about. I reassure Senerians that a border lockdown order will not be imposed until absolutely necessary." — The Prime Minister of Senerean

Meanwhile, a stagnating number of deaths has been reported around Senerean. There are fears that the Senerean government is keeping the number, hindering the public from preparing appropriately for the situation. Lockdown orders were also imposed across the Union.

From another perspective, doctors from across the nation still got confused about the cases being reported. A doctor from the Sea-cliff Hospital, Ninoarura told us: "The case reports being produced by Estican doctors are extremely accurate and we did try to match with the profiles of our patients, but the matching result is rather low. This is weird considering Senerean's healthcare system is closely related to the Estican counterpart. We are investigating deep into this, but it almost feels like Senerean's existing precautionary care is playing its part in this."

Citizens are extremely concerned with the government's message being conflicted with other governments. People across the nation have started to prepare for this "just like the good old Covid-19 days". Self-sustaining models were set up by homeowners to prepare for the worst, while rural areas braced for the lack of supply for the next few months. In the people's eyes, the future is rather dark.

At this time, information speed is extremely important, communication is crucial, and the truth is vital. Will this be another Covid-19 or this is just a flu? The question awaits for an answer.

# Chaos ensues this evening after two plane crashes
[b]BREAKING NEWS: Two planes shot down by military-grade missiles, the Protectors Cult take responsibility[/b]
This evening, two planes (both of Air Senerean) were shot down by military-grade missiles over Ninoarura and Nuvak, claiming 398 lives on board and an unconfirmed number of deaths on the ground. This is a surprise attack and completely unprompted by the Protectors Cult, who took full responsibility and warned the public "to appease the Gods' anger".

Because of the crash location in a densely populated area, the firefighting effort still continues until now. It is estimated that the damage is more than 100 million Xenerus per city and counting. Moreover, on-air firefighting is not an option due to the nature of the missile and the fear that further attacks may be possible. Traffic jams are also an issue, but the collaborative attitude of the citizens was extremely helpful.

According to sources, both planes were taken down in the same manner: a ground-to-air missile fired shortly after the plane took off. Because both planes were taking off during foggy weather in Ninoarura and Nuvak, establishing the source proved to be impossible. Moreover, the missiles flew at a short distance, making the military radar doesn’t have enough time to triangulate the position. However, the national grounding order was issued, because both planes were taken down with military-grade missiles.

Currently, police and the Emergency Response Unit from both cities are patrolling around the cities on high alert. Moreover, checkpoints were set up at the exits of both cities to check documents, creating huge traffic jams in both directions. The Ministry of National Security also suggested that the Protectors Cults may reside in the woods of the Xubaxu province and military search planes are being dispatched to scramble for the headquater of the cult. Information also suggested that the operation was being planned and ordered completely online.

[b]The Protectors and their belief[/b]
The Protectors Cult believes that they are the last stop of humanity before reaching the final breaking points of the Gods. They claimed that when the Last Star rises above the horizon, it marks the ultimate end of humanity. The virus, according to Protector believers, is a sign that the Gods are angry and it getting worse. In the Protectors' manifesto, Senerians are a superior race and when there are too many Senerians, the Gods afraid that Senerians will become aggressive and ignore the Gods. The Cult is the main supporter of the two-child-only policy and the parental licensing program to keep the Senerean population low, according to their explanation.

The Protectors Cult confirms: “If the number [of cases] continues, that means our sacrifice is not enough”.

The most surprising thing is the Protectors got through the strict regulations about the religious institution and weren’t labelled as a “cult” until today. The problem is they endorsed many progressive bills and are also advocates for the development of science in Senerean. They exerted no harm to the rights and freedoms of others, so they managed to slit through the cracks in the system.

[b]The government's future actions[/b]
Now, I am here at the meeting hall in Ninoarura. To protect the ministers, the identity of those who entered and left the building is kept secret. However, an ambulance just came to pick up the Minister of National Security. The Prime Minister just informed from the front door of the building that the Minister was exhausted after the trip to Estica but now has to face this crisis — they haven’t eaten since this lunch.

The next possible course of action for the government, according to experts suggested that the government may invoke the Emergency Act and temporarily suspend multiple rights and services to keep national security. That also means the next election will be delayed. It is impossible to predict will a short national union government will be established or not when the government is facing the Senerean’s flu and this attack from the Protectors Cult.

# Series of attack continues, strikes during midnight in Central Cluster.
At midnight, a ship moving 50 nautical miles (92km) away from the Central Cluster was being attacked with bombs. Details about the attack are unclear, but the ship quickly sank after the explosion, hinting a large amount of ammunition was detonated. The crew consists of 27 people, all Senerean citizens, departing from Nuvak with the destination is Ballinngs, carrying wood logs and timber. Despite the efforts, the lifeboat has not yet been found in the rough sea.

The Protectors once again informed their involvement in this attack, citing the cargo was depleting Senerean of its resources and there would be more to come. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a speech at the doorstep of the Ninoarura meeting hall, saying the government will not give in to the terrorist actions, but still suggest harbours and ports to operate with precautions. To ensure safety, the Coastal Emergency Response Unit also patrols ships around the densely populated area.

# Morning metro train bombed, more than 30 confirmed deaths
At 11:30 this morning, a commuter metro train in Laxura was being bombed. Detonated when the train approached the Laxura central station in the third car of the train, the initial blast instantly killed more than 20 people while the shock happened after that increased the death toll. Concussion and brain damage are among the injured.

The survivors managed to escape the train by using the walkway alongside the main rail. The firefighters quickly arrived at the scene to put out the flame as well as treat the wounded.

The Protectors Cult once again claim responsibility for this attack, claiming the attacks are not targeted but are completely random. It isn’t clear if the bomb was detonated remotely or if there is a presence of suicide bombing.

The Prime Minister just announced that the government will not issue a nationwide lockdown order, but is up to the provincial and municipality governments to take appropriate actions. The Prime Minister also suggested citizens not go out in crowded areas amidst the terrorist threat and the Senerean’s flu. So far, the two major cities Ninoarura and Nuvak have suspended most of the major events and called private organizers to take a similar course of action to protect the people, but no further actions were taken. Critics have claimed that this is a weak and indecisive move from the government in the middle of the Protectors crisis and the Senerean’s flu.

International communities, especially countries in the Almersen Union, have expressed their condolence. Ballinngs, Estica, and Wilhelma all expressed their willingness to send support for counter-terrorist actions.

# Against all of the odds, 27 sailors were found!
This morning, a lifeboat with 27 sailors onboard was miraculously found by the North Cluster Emergency Response Unit. Their original container ship was bombed and sunk this Sunday at midnight with the destination to [nation]Ballinngs[/nation].

This was considered to be nearly impossible because of the recent rough sea and the looming weather. However, while scanning the surface for the lifeboat, a helicopter saw flares being launched by the sailors. Help quickly arrived and pick up all of the crew members. "Inside the lifeboat are 27 happy people who are relieved to be rescued and brought home", said the Chief of the North Cluster Emergency Response Unit. The crew is now being treated at the local hospital before being transported back to Nuvak, their departure port. Nobody was injured or killed in the attack.

"It is extraordinary to have everybody on board following the protocols and procedures when the emergency happened. Collaboration and calmness are one of the main factors that led to the safety of the crew", said the captain, "except there is a member, which for obvious reasons I will keep their identity anonymous, got panicked and decided to jump off the ship. We have to rescue them [chuckle] but otherwise, it is amazing."

The ship is one of the initial targets for the Protectors when bombing major Senerean infrastructures. However, it has been 4 days since the last attack, and the government has found no extra evidence from the attacks. It has been reported that there are about 30 arrested nationwide relating to the Protectors Cult's attacks, but no official statement from the government was issued. On the other hand, the government has confirmed that the Senerean's flu has been registered to the official sickness database and is tracked. While other nations constantly confirm new cases, Senerean is now considerably slow in terms of pandemic preparedness. Will the government catch up with other nations from the Almersen Union, or will this turn out to be a devastating error from the government? The question awaits the answer...

This afternoon, the Ministry of Transportation (MTP) reopened the airspace for all international traffic after 10 days of a nationwide grounding order. All air traffic going through the nation shall resume like before, with the exception of flights transverse through the Xubaxu region (suspected Protectors’ headquarter) and the two cities that were attacked: Ninoarura and Nuvak. Commercial planes overflying these areas will be monitored heavily with both the standard procedure and the Northern Shield system to ensure the devastating attacks won’t happen again. Recreational activities, lightweight aircrafts, and private jets are not allowed in these areas.

# The Conservative Party won a landslide victory!
As the election result was announced, the Conservative Party established a majority government with the party leader, Ciel, as the Prime Minister of Senerean. As promised, multiple drastic changes will be introduced to "establish a free and open Senerean", with the foremost being extreme tax-cutting measures.

The lack of support for the Liberal Party is foreseeable. The last government's failure to properly respond to the Senerean's flu crisis as well as the Protectors' attacks ensures a certain end to the Liberal government after only one full term. Moreover, experts attributed the opposition's party leader, Ceil, as one of the main reasons for the defeat of the Liberal Party and the victorious win of the Conservative Party.

Ciel was born in Miaruko and later migrated to Senerean to complete his Bachelor's degree in human psychology. He soon got his Senerian citizenship after working as a therapist and later participated in a nationwide mental health research board. Ciel's political career took off after his contribution was acknowledged personally by the Minister of Health, but he changed to serve for the Conservative Party as the shadow Minister of Health, which helped him gain his position as the Minister of Health for one term before the Liberals took over again. Ciel then ran for the Conservative Party leadership and won with little margin to spare. However, thanks to his background and open-minded policies, he quickly gained support from left-wing voters even before the election and the disappointment in the Liberal government.

As a new government was formed, priorities were put on tax-slashing, allowing citizens to arms, adding the right to bear arms in the Constitution, as well as minuscule issues such as flag redesigning and holiday decorations of the Parliament. As a new bow colour is taking over the government, the Ciel administration will be tested by history and the stress of time will tell Senerians about whether they had made the right decision.

# The Flag Commission decided to honour the old flag pattern
As the Parliamentary Flag Commission reaches the final stages of a two-month process, a new flag is planned to be introduced next week. The majority of the chosen flags use the same triangular pattern on a 1:2 rectangle, while one finalist flag flipped the pattern horizontally. A darker green and blue shade will be introduced, along with a new star design replacing the old five-wing star. The orientation of the vertical flag will also be changed to comply with the typical vexillology convention instead of a counter-clockwise rotation like the old flag.

A member of the commission panel commented: "The new suggestions ensure a familiar shape, layout, and general colour that all Senerians can recognize, while a new star design will be much easier to redraw but still retain the elegant factor of the Northern Cross."

Currently, the commission is still debating whether the rotation of the symbolic asterism should be changed. While keeping the orientation vertically or horizontally ensures a much more organized arrangement, a diagonal asterism symbolizes a beautiful natural imperfection and the original rotation on the Cygnus star chart.

The Flag Commission comprises members with various artistic backgrounds and guests from across the nation to select from various redesign their nominees. If the new flag is passed by the government according to plan, it will start to be flown by the government on exactly the first of January.

# The Flag Commission has selected the new flag of Senerean
After much debate over the arrangement of the Northern Cross on the new flag, the Flag Commission has decided to keep the old arrangement with slight adjustments for position accuracy as well as alignment of the wings. This decision was not taken lightly, as changing the nation's flag means a new face of Senerean to the world.

Interviewing with the Head of the Commission, the Commissioner revealed the reason behind the specific arrangement of the stars and how to duplicate it: "The stars is basically aligned as the standard cross and rotate to match the diagonal line of the 1:2 flag. This arrangement ensures accuracy as well as easy to replicate." In the old flag, the Northern Cross was arranged without accurate numbers to ensure accuracy when replicate, something that the Commission was tasked to fix.

As well as an accurate arrangement, the Commission also changed the design of the stars itself. In the new flag, the stars were replaced with an eight-wing design (with four small wings) and resized to be 20 unit wide. Ctitics pointed out that the stars are too pointy (puns intended) and the enlarged stars take up too much space in the darker background. "I personally believe that the simplicity in the old flag truly stand for Senerian's spirit of minimalismn. I admit the fact that the new flag provides consistency, but dropping the five-wing star is a mistake in term of designing", said our designer, who we choose to interview because it is snowy outside and we don't want to stand in the cold.
