# Senerean flu or seasonal flu?
This afternoon, the Prime Minister addressed the accusation of other Member Nations of the Alermsen Union about Senerean’s flu outbreak. 

“The public should not be feared of this flu. The government is working hard to identify the possible cause of this but so far, no Senerians have been affected by the flu. Our researchers considered this to be a seasonal flu, but we will monitor the situation closely. We once again ask our citizens to remain calm.”

The Estican government announced 26 confirmed cases this morning and 2 deaths from the Wilhelma government. Lockdown precaution was imposed by many nations while the government denies any possible outbreak.

It is undeniable that Senerians are among the healthiest citizens in the Union. Despite that, speculations arise when it comes to the government’s speed in terms of crisis management. As the next election is looming, will this just be another easy victory for the liberal government, or this flu turn out to be a failed prediction by the running party that will change the government? The answer awaits...

# Where are the cases?
According to [url=https://www.nationstates.net/page=dispatch/id=1946360]Wilhelma and the Flanfairs headlines[/url], four schools have been closed today because of Senerean's flu. However, the alleged source of the flu denies all claims and still considers the disease seasonal flu. Why is there a conflict with the reports between Senerean and the rest of the Almersen Union?

The most important answer is that Senerean is refusing to collect or allow the collection of statistics about the flu. If all cases are reported as normal flu, the lack of statistics obviously made the understanding of the flu impossible. Despite that, multiple hospitals attempted to report Senerean's flu but so far, none has reported a complete case of Senerean's flu.

"I once again reinstate my point: this is a common flu. There is a possibility that the cases being reported are being confused during the cross-checking data since Senerean has found no death from flu alone, let alone the 'Senerean's flu' that people are talking about. I reassure Senerians that a border lockdown order will not be imposed until absolutely necessary." — The Prime Minister of Senerean

Meanwhile, a stagnating number of deaths has been reported around Senerean. There are fears that the Senerean government is keeping the number, hindering the public from preparing appropriately for the situation. Lockdown orders were also imposed across the Union. 

From another perspective, doctors from across the nation still got confused about the cases being reported. A doctor from the Sea-cliff Hospital, Ninoarura told us: "The case reports being produced by Estican doctors are extremely accurate and we did try to match with the profiles of our patients, but the matching result is rather low. This is weird considering Senerean's healthcare system is closely related to the Estican counterpart. We are investigating deep into this, but it almost feels like Senerean's existing precautionary care is playing its part in this."

Citizens are extremely concerned with the government's message being conflicted with other governments. People across the nation have started to prepare for this "just like the good old Covid-19 days". Self-sustaining models were set up by homeowners to prepare for the worst, while rural areas braced for the lack of supply for the next few months. In the people's eyes, the future is rather dark.

At this time, information speed is extremely important, communication is crucial, and the truth is vital. Will this be another Covid-19 or this is just a flu? The question awaits for an answer.

# Chaos ensues this evening after two plane crashes
[b]BREAKING NEWS: Two planes shot down by military-grade missiles, the Protectors Cult take responsibility[/b]
This evening, two planes (both of Air Senerean) were shot down by military-grade missiles over Ninoarura and Nuvak, claiming 398 lives on board and an unconfirmed number of deaths on the ground. This is a surprise attack and completely unprompted by the Protectors Cult, who took full responsibility and warned the public "to appease the Gods' anger".

Because of the crash location in a densely populated area, the firefighting effort still continues until now. It is estimated that the damage is more than 100 million Xenerus per city and counting. Moreover, on-air firefighting is not an option due to the nature of the missile and the fear that further attacks may be possible. Traffic jams are also an issue, but the collaborative attitude of the citizens was extremely helpful. 

According to sources, both planes were taken down in the same manner: a ground-to-air missile fired shortly after the plane took off. Because both planes were taking off during foggy weather in Ninoarura and Nuvak, establishing the source proved to be impossible. Moreover, the missiles flew at a short distance, making the military radar doesn’t have enough time to triangulate the position. However, the national grounding order was issued, because both planes were taken down with military-grade missiles.

Currently, police and the Emergency Response Unit from both cities are patrolling around the cities on high alert. Moreover, checkpoints were set up at the exits of both cities to check documents, creating huge traffic jams in both directions. The Ministry of National Security also suggested that the Protectors Cults may reside in the woods of the Xubaxu province and military search planes are being dispatched to scramble for the headquater of the cult. Information also suggested that the operation was being planned and ordered completely online.

[b]The Protectors and their belief[/b]
The Protectors Cult believes that they are the last stop of humanity before reaching the final breaking points of the Gods. They claimed that when the Last Star rises above the horizon, it marks the ultimate end of humanity. The virus, according to Protector believers, is a sign that the Gods are angry and it getting worse. In the Protectors' manifesto, Senerians are a superior race and when there are too many Senerians, the Gods afraid that Senerians will become aggressive and ignore the Gods. The Cult is the main supporter of the two-child-only policy and the parental licensing program to keep the Senerean population low, according to their explanation.

The Protectors Cult confirms: “If the number [of cases] continues, that means our sacrifice is not enough”.

The most surprising thing is the Protectors got through the strict regulations about the religious institution and weren’t labelled as a “cult” until today. The problem is they endorsed many progressive bills and are also advocates for the development of science in Senerean. They exerted no harm to the rights and freedoms of others, so they managed to slit through the cracks in the system.

[b]The government's future actions[/b]
Now, I am here at the meeting hall in Ninoarura. To protect the ministers, the identity of those who entered and left the building is kept secret. However, an ambulance just came to pick up the Minister of National Security. The Prime Minister just informed from the front door of the building that the Minister was exhausted after the trip to Estica but now has to face this crisis — they haven’t eaten since this lunch. 

The next possible course of action for the government, according to experts suggested that the government may invoke the Emergency Act and temporarily suspend multiple rights and services to keep national security. That also means the next election will be delayed. It is impossible to predict will a short national union government will be established or not when the government is facing the Senerean’s flu and this attack from the Protectors Cult.

# Series of attack continues, strikes during midnight in Central Cluster.
At midnight, a ship moving 50 nautical miles (92km) away from the Central Cluster was being attacked with bombs. Details about the attack are unclear, but the ship quickly sank after the explosion, hinting a large amount of ammunition was detonated. The crew consists of 27 people, all Senerean citizens, departing from Nuvak with the destination is Ballinngs, carrying wood logs and timber. Despite the efforts, the lifeboat has not yet been found in the rough sea. 

The Protectors once again informed their involvement in this attack, citing the cargo was depleting Senerean of its resources and there would be more to come. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a speech at the doorstep of the Ninoarura meeting hall, saying the government will not give in to the terrorist actions, but still suggest harbours and ports to operate with precautions. To ensure safety, the Coastal Emergency Response Unit also patrols ships around the densely populated area.

# Morning metro train bombed, more than 30 confirmed deaths
At 11:30 this morning, a commuter metro train in Laxura was being bombed. Detonated when the train approached the Laxura central station in the third car of the train, the initial blast instantly killed more than 20 people while the shock happened after that increased the death toll. Concussion and brain damage are among the injured. 

The survivors managed to escape the train by using the walkway alongside the main rail. The firefighters quickly arrived at the scene to put out the flame as well as treat the wounded.

The Protectors Cult once again claim responsibility for this attack, claiming the attacks are not targeted but are completely random. It isn’t clear if the bomb was detonated remotely or if there is a presence of suicide bombing.

The Prime Minister just announced that the government will not issue a nationwide lockdown order, but is up to the provincial and municipality governments to take appropriate actions. The Prime Minister also suggested citizens not go out in crowded areas amidst the terrorist threat and the Senerean’s flu. So far, the two major cities Ninoarura and Nuvak have suspended most of the major events and called private organizers to take a similar course of action to protect the people, but no further actions were taken. Critics have claimed that this is a weak and indecisive move from the government in the middle of the Protectors crisis and the Senerean’s flu.

International communities, especially countries in the Almersen Union, have expressed their condolence. Ballinngs, Estica, and Wilhelma all expressed their willingness to send support for counter-terrorist actions.
