Later run as the Prime Minister for the Conservative party and got the votes thanks to a rather open attitude.</p>
                <i><b>Spoiler:</b> While at his friend's house for a party, a fire broke out. He then helped the evacuation effort and heroically saved people. However, when the fire broke out, he was having a cosplaying party with his friends and was wearing a skirt (probably Astolfo's skirt). The image of him with the skirt saving a child through the fire soon spread out, and the Conservative Party decided to kick him after an internal conflict. He resigned then cross the floor to become a shadown minister, this time for the Liberal Party. Supports for the Conservative party soon switch to the Liberal Party. He has a sister Sora who will probably take on politics later in her life.</i>
