            <p>To the General Assembly of the Union,</p>
            <p><b>On the Topic of Territorial Disputes on the Island of Balling Baller and Estica's Drafted Peaceful Resolution</b></p>
            <p>We, <a href="nation=senerean" class="nlink"><img src="/images/flags/uploads/senerean__699266t2.png" class="miniflag" alt=""><span class="nnameblock">Senerean</span></a>, respectfully disagree with <a href="nation=estica" class="nlink"><img src="/images/flags/uploads/estica__726691t2.png" class="miniflag" alt=""><span class="nnameblock">Estica</span></a>. An itemized list would be appropriate to address the issue in their drafted resolution, but acknowledging the endorsement from the President, allow us to direct our attention to the daily life of an average citizen on the Island of <a href="nation=balling_baller" class="nlink"><img src="/images/flags/uploads/balling_baller__502228t2.png" class="miniflag" alt=""><span class="nnameblock">Balling Baller</span></a>.</p>
            <p>We understand this is the dispute over the control of the Island of <a href="nation=balling_baller" class="nlink"><span class="nnameblock">Balling Baller</span></a>, but the daily life of citizens will be affected drastically if the island is divided into two. Families will be separated, for that is the obvious fact. Can you now imagine how many parents' promises are broken, because now, they must tell their children that crossing the island requires you to go through a ten-kilometre strip of land that was put into place because two governments decided so? What about the water body where multiple fishers and lives depend on crossing it daily? The establishment of the buffer zone can be considered similar to the Berlin Wall which separated many people from each other; we refrain to use Korea's DMZ as an example because of the obvious political separation that happen before the DMZ, but <a href="nation=balling_baller" class="nlink"><span class="nnameblock">Balling Baller</span></a> itself is a united island with no prior separation. This sudden implementation of the plan is deemed unexpected by the Senerian Government, and we believe the people of <a href="nation=balling_baller" class="nlink"><span class="nnameblock">Balling Baller</span></a> also think the same thing.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it has come to our knowledge that the political freedom of <a href="nation=balling_baller" class="nlink"><span class="nnameblock">Balling Baller</span></a> is considered to be excellent by the World Census. World Census is an independent organization that is trusted around the NationStates by many nations so we believe that the Grand Assembly should give that information necessary burden. That is a fact, so the Senerean government believes that the current elected government of <a href="nation=balling_baller" class="nlink"><span class="nnameblock">Balling Baller</span></a> can speak for the citizens on the island. Moreover, the island also installed a public protest policy, and elections are free and open to all citizens. We hope that information can give the Grand Assembly an insight into the current situation on the island; such information already prompted Senerean to seek more information from <a href="nation=balling_baller" class="nlink"><span class="nnameblock">Balling Baller</span></a>, but we cannot act by ourselves. We understand that this matter happens outside our border, therefore we can only ask the Grand Assembly to inquire for more information on the government of <a href="nation=balling_baller" class="nlink"><span class="nnameblock">Balling Baller</span></a> and their opinion on the drafted Peaceful Resolution. Nevertheless, such an important matter requires direct input from the citizens. The Senerian Government highly suggests the Grand Assembly organize a public referendum on the matter that is open for all citizens of <a href="nation=balling_baller" class="nlink"><span class="nnameblock">Balling Baller</span></a>.</p>
            <p>In a few words, this message suggests that the Grand Assembly:<br>- considers and assesses the situation for the citizens on the island of <a href="nation=balling_baller" class="nlink"><span class="nnameblock">Balling Baller</span></a>;<br>- re-evaluates the possible consequence of Estica's Drafted Peaceful Resolution, specifically the planned buffer zone;<br>- examine the government transparency as well as the political freedom in <a href="nation=balling_baller" class="nlink"><span class="nnameblock">Balling Baller</span></a>; and<br>- organize a public referendum following the Instant Runoff System on the matter, listing clearly the options for citizens as well as which government suggested it.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Senerian Government wishes for a peaceful and democratic resolution to the territorial disputes. We hope that by creating a simple-worded and straightforward message, we can create a comfortable and productive environment for the three governments to orderly resolve this matter and satisfy the citizens. We hope that the Grand Assembly prioritizes the need of the disputed territory's citizens and considers it to be the first concern when coming up with a solution.</p>
            <p>We wish everybody a nice day and peace be with them,<br>The Head of State of the Senerian Government, on behalf of the Government of Senerean.</p></div>
