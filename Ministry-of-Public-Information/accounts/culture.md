# Valley @ Beehive avenue bathhouse
Building using Japanese building type, a small but welcoming bathhouse located at the corner of Valley ave. and Beehive ave. was fully booked. The bathhouse itself includes one public bath and one private bath, but both require customers to call in for an appointment beforehand. Reservation took around 1 week, but many said it is worth the wait.

The building itself contributed greatly to the atmosphere of the bathhouse which many seek for. Using spruce wood and white concrete, it creates a harmonious yet contrasting colour scheme. It is the architect’s favourite colour scheme, and he wants to use it with proper lighting and location. The building is located close to the second tree that Omnomnom build in Senerean, which has a blue cold feeling, the opposite of the yellowish-warm colour that the architect wants to convey to its customer. This helps the bather to feel like they are protected from the outside world by dipping themself into the steaming water.

# International negotiation hall
The government must keep diplomatic ties with other nations to create mutual benefits, and it is necessary to create a place where all nations can meet to discuss issues. Today, the construction of the international negotiation hall was completed after several failed attempts, to mark Senerean huge leap in international influence.

Located at the corner of Highland st. and Embassy ave., it is close to three major embassies that kept a close relationship with Senerean. On the opposite side of the avenue is a broadcast center to deliver the most important decisions to citizens and people around the world.

Embedded below the hall is also a commission meeting room suitable for many events that require private discussion.

The architecture mostly got its design from the White House, but the designer wants a building that represents Senerean’s transparency with citizens, so the negotiation house was built with an open design. Initially, the architecture wants a modern design that incorporate green space on the top, but that idea was scrapped. Instead, the designer use prismarine to represent the Senerean flag: blue on top supported by white and green raise all of them.

Despite the structures and architecture being rather familiar, the designer tried to thrive for its uniqueness in the pillars. Admittedly it doesn’t stand out compared to other buildings, the building does help to harmonize the scenery and express one of the most important strengths in Senerean: diversity and acceptance.

# Human Rights Tribunal
Located near the corner of 2023 ave @ Highland st, the Human Rights Tribunal was built to resolve complaints about issues relating to human rights.

The structure was built with a sense of respect, so it used quartz as its main material. The colour white represents dignity, integrity, and transparency. The layout of the interior is also interesting because the designer makes both competing sides face each other, to tell the truth, and just only the truth.

The roof is also made with deep intentions in the designer’s mind. It creates a much more open environment for transparency but also helps to reduce tensions in hearings. Birchwood was chosen as the primary wood theme for the tribunal to recognize the native plant of the land.

Initially, the plot of land was reserved for a different plan. However, the original builder for that land decided to choose another place, so the designers need to come up with something for this location. Because there is a mediation hall downhill, the designer chose to build the tribunal hearing in this location. It was close to a frequent end-to-end train station and situate in a dense walking network. The penguin statue can also be seen from this location, giving a nice touch to its intention.

All hearings are public, so citizens are welcome to pay a visit to this hall at any time. People come here to listen to a case, to watch our legal system, or just simply to enjoy the building itself. This represents Senerean’s integrity, the truth in the true north, and the transparent legal procedure in our nation.

# Coral Aquarium
Located at the connection of Uphill and Myrtle, the Coral Aquarium was built as a tribute to MgTyle, the person who helped developed Nuvak shoreline nature.

The aquarium itself was built from spruce wood with a rather open-space design. One notable design of the aquarium is it only has a lantern for external lighting; the inside was lit using sea pickles.

There is still free space on the aquarium land plot, but there isn’t any official plan to use the empty space. Initially, the land was reserved for Omnomnom but due to the delay in the construction plan, the government decided to take back the land and reserve a different plot for Omnomnom.

Situated in the bustling commercial district, the Senerean government hoped that the building will raise awareness of the declining bio-diversity of Senerean. The entry fee to the aquarium is free, so anybody can visit the aquarium to see all 5 types of coral in Senerean.

If you happen to be around the waterfront area of Nuvak, remember to visit the Coral Aquarium. Not only will it introduce you to the diverse aspect of the Senerean environment, but it also is a relaxing place to visit after a stressful week of work.
