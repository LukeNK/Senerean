# The Bank of Senerean has published the tail design of the new coin set!
The Bank of Senerean has released new coin designs which promote inclusiveness and Senerean's modernization progress. The design also promises to have additional aid marking for visually impaired individuals, to which the Bank of Senerean will release an official guide on the marking in the official wide-scale release later. The following is what the Bank of Senerean has informed the press:

[b][u]General standards[/u][/b]
- The coin's radius will decrease by 1mm for every smaller denomination; the 2 xeneru coins have a radius of 14mm (diameter is 28mm).
- The top arc on the reserve side has visual impairment features.
- The tail side [b]must[/b] have the minting year and the denomination.
- The text font family on all coins is [url=https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa]Comfortaa[/url].

The coin has the signature symbol of [url=https://virtualyoutuber.fandom.com/wiki/Petra_Gurin]Vtuber Petra Gurin[/url] with a snow track under it. The visual impairment marking is a continuous strip representing the northern aurora, while the bottom arc has the next "[i]Senerean - 2 xeneru - Xenereanu[/i]". The choice of including Petra Gurin stems from the fact that her character is a penguin, Senerean's official animal.

This coin has the map of Senerean on it along with the standard map of the Northern Cross. The Bank of Senerean representative revealed that the head side's design is minted to commemorate [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape-kun]Grape-kun[/url] and his attachment to Kemono Friends anime franchise's Humboldt penguin. The Bank inform that the design of this coin may change drastically when the official release date arrive.

This includes a symbol of Adelie penguin's feet, textured like a topographic map. The head face of this coin contains the face of an Adelie penguin, making this coin rather straightforward in design.

The tail design of this coin is similar to the 1 xeneru coin except the mainland area is textured to show the terrain of Senerean having extreme mountains on the Eastern side. Details on the observe side of the coin are unconfirmed, but it is possible that the designer will include a map of the Northern Cross.

The northern aurora texture is implemented as the northern light to cover over Senerean as well as being the visual aids marking. The 10 mika coin heavily utilizes the interpolated lines as a security feature as well as decorative in both the observe and reserve sides. The tail side also opts to put the nation's name following the nation's Eastern side, blending it with the design instead of creating a full ring around the coin. It is known that the head side of this coin is the only coin that includes the nation's motto "From sea to stars" in both English and Milaru.

Once again includes a specially-textured Senerean map, the 5 mika coin includes four-wing stars as its main texture. When designing the coin, the designers face a challenge when placing the nation name at the bottom, to which they settled with putting "Xenereanu" on the top because it is longer than "Senerean". The design of the head of this coin is also based on astronomy with the front being designed to represent nature and stars by having Ursa Major and Ursa Minor drawn as mother and baby bear respectively. 

# New domestic stamp set published by Senerean's Post
This morning, the Senerean Post released a new design for the domestic stamp set that aims to promote Senerean Vocaloid culture. The theme of the set surrounds Hatsune Miku's Magical Mirai and looks back at her long connecting history with the nation. This new stamp set also introduced Denomination Code Pane (DCP) to increase clarity when purchasing and straightforward the process of communicating stamp price.

[b][u]Denomination Code Pane[/u][/b]
Denomination Code is a two-character code, with the first one indicating the category of the stamp and the second character showing the denomination in the category. Currently, there are two major categories: international and domestic, represented with "I" and "D" respectively. The following table describes the category denominations:

For mail heavier than 500g, Senerean Post will price the package as a parcel. It is possible to include multiple stamps with different denominations or categories, as long as the total price of the stamps exceeds the cost to transport the package.

# New land development tax constants were issued
This afternoon, a new tax calculation method was issued and will start to be implemented next month. This tax does not affect any already existing land developments, but only on new developments. Pending applications will still be subjected to the old tax.

The new tax issued was one of the measures made by the government to expand the budget in light of following the new environment treaty signed by the Prime Minister this Monday. The new tax method hoped to centralize development plans by reducing tax for builds with areas between 160 m^2 and 225 m^2. Meanwhile, smaller buildings may get taxed up to 225% compared to the old tax to remove the incentive to build mini-homes and compact homes out of health concerns being raised recently. However, the "megastructure" tax category was also being raised by 150% which many economists consider too high to support the Senerean economy.

[center][i]The new (green line) tax method compared with the old (black line) tax method[/i][/center]

Commented on the raised tax, a homeowner said: "I think the new tax is rather harsh on property owners and developers, as it increased linearly with the area which is an exponent value of dimension. It also can be considered a drawback since now it creates an incentive for citizens to build mini-skyscrapers with small land footprints, making it dangerous during disasters."

Meanwhile, meeting with the Premier of Nenerean, who happened to be the daughter of the homeowner we interviewed above, commented: "I think the new tax issued is considered a forward-thinking move by the government, but it is also up to the municipality government to manage other aspects like construction, infrastructure, and managing to fully incorporate."

The announced tax hike was met with anger by the official opposition party in the national Parliament: "Mr. Speaker, this gentleman here is trying to protect the future, but with this tax hike, we would be homeless before we can 'rebuild our home'. Ballooned housing, decreased in service, increased in tax, and insane decisions: this Prime Minister is trying to smash our economy harder than our sponsor, [i][product placement][/i]. I wish this Parliament could consider my words, both what I said before and during my product placement. Thank you."
