# The Senerian Government's opinion on the 2023 Israel-Hamas war
As the Head of State of Senerean, I am here today to address the Israel-Hamas situation that has happened over the last few days. The Senerian Government stands strongly against the damages inflicted on civilians and condemns actions violating international laws.
The war has been raging without a clear separation between civilian and military targets. Allow me to cite a quote from a woman who has to endure the consequence of this political conflict: “Forget Islam, Christianity, or Judaism. Where is humanity?” The Senerian Government doesn’t pretend to understand the struggle these people have to go through. Still, we are calling on the international community to support the humanitarian operations happening in this war-torn area.

We feel ashamed that the government from both sides refuses to collaborate to bring speedy help to the people. However, we understand the complications in negotiation and wish to show our eagerness to help both countries bring peace to their people. There is no weakness in bringing peace, but there is weakness in solving conflict through wars.

Senerean once again begs for the collaboration of both nations by thinking about the people.
