    [i]An example of a DX, *P, and D0 stamp 
    with the postmark issued from Ninoarura.

When stamping cancellation, it is recommended to the operator stamp in a way that the postmark covers either the Denomination Code Pane or the price of the stamps. However, many opt to stamp the tail of the postmark over the denomination to keep the design of the stamp visible. The design of the tails also indicates the region where the package is processed which also shows the general terrain in an artistic way. The following table lists the tail design of each region:
